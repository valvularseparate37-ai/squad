# Runtime identity beacon for coordinator canary cases 3 & 4

Date: 2026-07-21
Related: PR #1517, `docs/canary-identity-matrix.md`, issue #1461

## Problem

The current dual canary can only report on the coordinator prompt when that prompt is visible to the model. If both canaries are absent, the in-prompt observation is identical for two different situations:

1. the Squad coordinator custom agent was selected, but its `squad.agent.md` payload failed to inject entirely; and
2. the running agent is a proven non-Squad agent that should not receive the Squad coordinator payload.

A prompt-contained check cannot classify the first situation because the instructions that would perform the check are absent too.

## Two-state reclassification recap

The dual canary should be treated as a two-state payload-integrity detector within an independently-known Squad coordinator session:

- HEAD present + EOF present: coordinator payload loaded fully.
- HEAD present + EOF absent: coordinator payload loaded but was truncated; halt.

`HEAD absent + EOF absent` is externally unobservable from inside the missing payload. It is not a success state and cannot prove safe non-Squad discrimination.

## Owning runtime surface

Repository inspection shows Squad installs `.github/agents/squad.agent.md` and points users or wrapper processes at `copilot --agent squad`, but this repo does not own the custom-agent resolver or the file-read / prompt-assembly path.

Observed boundary:

- `squad init` installs/advises the custom-agent path and invocation (`packages/squad-cli/src/cli/core/templates.ts:31-36`, `packages/squad-cli/src/cli/core/init.ts:142-155`, `packages/squad-cli/src/cli/core/init.ts:515-518`).
- `squad upgrade` refreshes `.github/agents/squad.agent.md` from the template (`packages/squad-cli/src/cli/core/upgrade.ts:1048`, `packages/squad-cli/src/cli/core/upgrade.ts:1102-1108`, `packages/squad-cli/src/cli/core/upgrade.ts:1124-1137`).
- `packages/squad-cli` passes through `copilotFlags`, `agentCmd`, or `--agent <config.agent>` to the `copilot` process, but does not read/assemble `.github/agents/*.agent.md` into model messages (`packages/squad-cli/src/cli/commands/watch/agent-spawn.ts:95-140`, `packages/squad-cli/src/cli/commands/loop.ts:136-148`, `packages/squad-cli/src/cli/commands/watch/index.ts:608-615`, `packages/squad-cli/src/cli/commands/copilot-bridge.ts:72-84`).
- The SDK wrapper also confirms that the Copilot CLI `--agent` flag is the path that reads on-disk agent definitions (`src/Squad.Agents.AI/SquadAgent.cs:249-282`, `src/Squad.Agents.AI/SquadAgentOptions.cs:87-112`, `src/Squad.Agents.AI/README.md:155-165`).

Therefore the reliable identity beacon must be a GitHub Copilot CLI host capability captured at the **agent-selection step** and persisted in host/session metadata before any `.agent.md` file access. Squad-provided MCP state tools cannot close this gap; if the coordinator payload is wholly absent, no instruction inside that absent payload can tell the model to call any `squad_state_*` identity tool.

## Host-owned pre-ingestion state machine

The host must evaluate this state machine outside the prompt. The preregistration unit is the **execution envelope**, not just the prompt artifact; the host tool inventory is part of the measured envelope. The state machine has ordered selection/read/attach events, two orthogonal artifact-integrity verdicts (transport integrity for enforcement and release integrity for reporting/provenance), and an orthogonal inventory-drift validity dimension for telemetry joins.

### Ordered fields

1. `selected_agent_id`
   - Immutable selection record created at agent-selection time **before any file access**.
   - Carries raw host identity and registry keys, for example:
     - `custom_agent.name = "squad"`
     - `custom_agent.file = ".github/agents/squad.agent.md"`
     - `custom_agent.role = "root-coordinator"`
     - `agent_version = "<resolved Squad agent/template version>"`
     - `client_id = "<host client identifier>"`
     - `client_version = "<host client version>"`
   - Must include host timestamp or monotonic order (for example, `selected_at` / `selection_order`).

2. `payload_read_status`
   - Separate READ-dimension transition recorded by the host **after** the `.agent.md` read attempt.
   - Enum: `LOADED`, `TRUNCATED`, `EMPTY`, `ABSENT`.
   - `TRUNCATED` is reserved for a partial **file read** proven by expected/actual byte counts, expected EOF evidence, or equivalent host read evidence.
   - A completed file read whose prompt attachment is clipped is `payload_read_status=LOADED` plus `prompt_attach_status=ATTACHED_PARTIAL`; do not encode attach clipping as read truncation.
   - Must record `source_sha_after_read` when bytes were read.

3. `prompt_attach_status`
   - Records what actually reached the assembled prompt.
   - Enum: `ATTACHED_FULL`, `ATTACHED_PARTIAL`, `NOT_ATTACHED`.
   - Must record `attached_sha` when bytes were attached, computed by the host over the **assembled artifact**.

### Transport integrity (enforcement axis)

`transport_integrity ∈ { INTACT, PARTIAL, UNKNOWN }`

This axis detects read/assembly loss and is enforced fail-closed. It compares `source_sha_after_read` to `attached_sha` **and** requires independent source completeness proof. Hash equality alone is insufficient: a partial host read can match an equally partial attachment.

- `INTACT`: source proven fully read by EOF/boundary evidence or expected byte length; `attached_sha == source_sha_after_read`; attached artifact contains required boundaries (HEAD and EOF canaries).
- `PARTIAL`: read or assembly truncation detected, including missing EOF/boundary, short byte length, partial file read, or attach clipping.
- `UNKNOWN`: insufficient evidence to prove transport integrity.

Policy: `PARTIAL` => `HALT_CORRUPT` (proven read/assembly loss). `UNKNOWN` => `UNKNOWN_HALT` (insufficient evidence; halts for safety but is not classified as proven corruption). Both stop the session, but the distinction is required for telemetry so missing evidence does not inflate the corruption count.

### Release integrity (reporting/provenance axis)

`release_integrity ∈ { VERIFIED, MISMATCH, UNREGISTERED }`

This axis compares `source_sha_after_read` with an optional trusted, preferably signed or release-bound manifest keyed by (`agent_version`, `client_id`, `client_version`). The expected SHA provenance rule applies here only: expected release SHAs must come from the trusted host-side manifest and must NEVER be derived from attached or assembled bytes.

- `VERIFIED`: `source_sha_after_read` matches the trusted manifest entry.
- `MISMATCH`: `source_sha_after_read` differs from the trusted manifest entry for that version (wrong or mutated release).
- `UNREGISTERED`: no manifest entry exists, the version key is unknown, the artifact is user-local, or the Squad artifact is newly updated/unpublished.

Policy: no manifest entry or unknown version key => `UNREGISTERED`, never `MISMATCH`, and never accept `attached_sha` as fallback. `UNREGISTERED` is surfaced distinctly and does **not** by itself halt a healthy session. Only `MISMATCH` escalates/halts as a proven wrong release.

### Inventory drift (execution-envelope validity axis)

`inventory_drift ∈ { NONE, EXPECTED_VARIANT, INVALIDATING }`

The host tool inventory is part of the execution envelope and must be preregistered before execution. Lazy discovery, auth, and MCP availability can mutate resident tool context after launch, so inventory capture is per-turn, not once per session:

- Capture a canonical baseline host tool inventory before the first turn.
- Capture the host tool inventory immediately before **each measured turn**.
- Record the raw non-secret tool manifest, the manifest hash, and the canonicalizer + serializer versions used to produce the hash for every snapshot.
- Publish in the first preflight schema emitted before execution: the `inventory_drift` status field plus the exact before-and-after non-secret manifest diff.

Outcomes:

- `NONE`: manifest unchanged versus the canonical baseline manifest.
- `EXPECTED_VARIANT`: drift was declared in advance and fully captured. This becomes a separately labeled variant cell and is never silently pooled with the primary cell.
- `INVALIDATING`: manifest is missing, or drift removes a required measurement/instrumentation tool. This invalidates the affected run at per-turn granularity.

Quarantine rule: drift that is fully captured but undeclared is quarantined as `EXPLORATORY`; it is never pooled with the primary cell. `inventory_drift` is orthogonal to `transport_integrity` and `release_integrity`: invalidating drift invalidates a run's telemetry join without implying artifact corruption.

### Frozen transition invariants

1. `selected_agent_id` is emitted before `payload_read_status`.
2. `payload_read_status` is emitted before `prompt_attach_status`.
3. `transport_integrity` is computed by the host on source/read/assembled artifacts, outside the prompt, using `source_sha_after_read`, `attached_sha`, boundary markers, and independent source completeness proof.
4. `release_integrity` is computed separately from a trusted manifest keyed by (`agent_version`, `client_id`, `client_version`) and `source_sha_after_read`.
5. Inventory snapshots are captured before the first turn and immediately before each measured turn, with raw non-secret manifest, manifest hash, canonicalizer version, serializer version, and before/after diff emitted in the first preflight schema before execution.
6. Any missing event in the ordered sequence resolves to `UNKNOWN`; absent evidence never resolves to success.
7. `selected + missing` must never collapse into `not selected`.

### Decision function

Evaluated outside the prompt:

| Host state | Outcome |
|---|---|
| `selected_agent_id` set + `transport_integrity=INTACT` + `release_integrity=VERIFIED` | `LOADED` |
| `selected_agent_id` set + `transport_integrity=INTACT` + `release_integrity=UNREGISTERED` | `LOADED_WITH_REPORT`; unregistered-local / unregistered-release report; MUST NOT halt |
| `selected_agent_id` set + `transport_integrity=INTACT` + `release_integrity=MISMATCH` | `HALT_RELEASE_MISMATCH`; proven wrong or mutated release |
| `selected_agent_id` set + `transport_integrity=PARTIAL` | `HALT_CORRUPT`; proven read/assembly transport loss dominates release status |
| `selected_agent_id` set + `transport_integrity=UNKNOWN` | `UNKNOWN_HALT`; insufficient transport evidence dominates release status and is not proven corruption |
| Any measured turn with `inventory_drift=INVALIDATING` | telemetry join invalidated for that turn; this does not imply artifact corruption |
| Any measured turn with undeclared but captured drift | quarantine as `EXPLORATORY`; never pool with the primary cell |
| `selected_agent_id` absent because a Squad coordinator was independently proven not selected | `SKIP`; safe non-Squad classification is based on host selection state, not canary absence |
| Any missing event in the expected ordered sequence | `UNKNOWN_HALT`; absent evidence never resolves to success and is not proven corruption |

## Acceptance tests

Each fixture must assert the final outcome **and** the raw ordered event sequence: selection record -> read result -> attach result -> `transport_integrity` -> `release_integrity` -> per-turn `inventory_drift`. Each fixture records both artifact-verdict axes, the inventory-drift axis, artifact SHAs when available, and the raw non-secret tool manifest/hash/canonicalizer/serializer metadata for each pre-turn snapshot.

| Fixture | Setup | Required ordered evidence | Expected outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Full payload, registered | Select `--agent squad`; full `squad.agent.md` read and attached; manifest entry exists | `selected_agent_id` set -> `payload_read_status=LOADED`, `source_sha_after_read` -> `prompt_attach_status=ATTACHED_FULL`, `attached_sha` -> `transport_integrity=INTACT` -> `release_integrity=VERIFIED` -> `inventory_drift=NONE` or declared `EXPECTED_VARIANT` | `LOADED` |
| 2. Head-only / oversized-prompt clip | Select `--agent squad`; source may read fully, but assembled prompt loses tail/EOF | ordered events emitted; `prompt_attach_status=ATTACHED_PARTIAL` or missing boundary; `transport_integrity=PARTIAL`; release verdict still recorded if possible | `HALT_CORRUPT` |
| 3. Missing/empty Squad payload | Select `--agent squad`; suppress, empty, or fail reading coordinator payload | `selected_agent_id` set -> `payload_read_status=EMPTY` or `ABSENT` -> `prompt_attach_status=NOT_ATTACHED` -> `transport_integrity=UNKNOWN`; release usually `UNREGISTERED`/unavailable | `UNKNOWN_HALT` |
| 4. Proven non-Squad | Host proves Squad coordinator was not selected | Squad `selected_agent_id` absent; non-Squad/default selection evidence emitted by host | `SKIP` |
| 5. WRONG-VERSION | Full source read and full attachment, but source SHA differs from trusted manifest for (`agent_version`, `client_id`, `client_version`) | `transport_integrity=INTACT`; `release_integrity=MISMATCH`; source/attached SHA recorded | `HALT_RELEASE_MISMATCH` |
| 6. LEGITIMATE UNREGISTERED-LOCAL | Healthy user-local custom agent or freshly-updated/unpublished Squad artifact with no manifest entry | `transport_integrity=INTACT`; `release_integrity=UNREGISTERED`; source/attached SHA recorded | `LOADED_WITH_REPORT`; MUST NOT false-halt |

Fixtures 5 and 6 exist to measure whether safety halts protect users without an unacceptable healthy-session false-halt rate. Telemetry must keep `HALT_CORRUPT` separate from `UNKNOWN_HALT` so missing evidence is not counted as proven corruption. Fixture 6 is especially important: registry staleness or local customization must not be converted into a release `MISMATCH` or transport failure. Additional inventory-drift fixtures should prove `EXPECTED_VARIANT` creates a separately labeled cell, `INVALIDATING` invalidates only affected turns, and undeclared captured drift is quarantined as `EXPLORATORY`.

## Caveman telemetry join protocol (not started)

When Caveman joins, pin the static identity **before execution**:

- artifact SHA: `525a919f2b8c3c2586dcb2862de3cff63c85128cd63702e96c83be83d0ed631f`
- client, client version, model, tokenizer
- raw usage/cache objects
- fresh-vs-continued condition
- per-turn non-secret tool inventory manifests, hashes, canonicalizer versions, serializer versions, and inventory-drift status/diff

Run one fresh session and one continued session. Join telemetry only on the exact static identity above. Caveman remains **NOT-STARTED**.

## In-Squad vs upstream split

**In Squad's control:** install and upgrade the custom-agent file, pass/advise `--agent squad`, keep canary payload-integrity wording accurate, write/load `.mcp.json`, document Cases 1-4, and consume the future host state machine when exposed.

**Upstream Copilot CLI capability required:** the host-owned state machine above, evaluated before and outside prompt ingestion, plus the optional trusted/signed release manifest keyed by (`agent_version`, `client_id`, `client_version`) and per-turn non-secret tool-inventory snapshots. The `.agent.md` file must not be able to overwrite, suppress, or fabricate `selected_agent_id`, `payload_read_status`, `prompt_attach_status`, `source_sha_after_read`, `attached_sha`, `transport_integrity`, `release_integrity`, or `inventory_drift`.
