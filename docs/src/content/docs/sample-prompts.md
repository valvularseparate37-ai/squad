---

## Quick Builds

Small projects that ship in a single session. Good for parallel fan-out and fast iteration.

---

### 1. CLI Pomodoro Timer

```
I'm building a cross-platform CLI pomodoro timer in Python:
- Configurable work/break intervals (25/5/15 defaults)
- Persistent stats tracker (local JSON)
- Desktop notifications (macOS, Windows, Linux)
- Focus mode: blocks domains via /etc/hosts (with undo)
- --report flag for weekly stats table

Set up the team. I want this done fast — everyone works at once.
```

**What it demonstrates:**
- Parallel fan-out on a small, well-scoped project
- Backend handles timer logic while systems agent tackles cross-platform notifications
- Tester writes test cases from spec while implementation is in flight

---

### 2. Markdown Static Site Generator

```
Zero-dependency static site generator in Node.js: markdown→HTML with built-in template, generates index page, outputs to dist/. Support front matter (title, date, tags), tag index pages, RSS feed. No frameworks — just fs, path, and a custom markdown parser.

Set up the team and start building.
```

**What it demonstrates:**
- Agents own distinct pipeline components (parser, template engine, RSS, file I/O)
- Tester writes test cases from spec while others build in parallel
- Front matter format decisions propagate via decisions.md

---

### 3. Retro Snake Game

```
Browser Snake game (vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, no frameworks):
- Canvas rendering at 60fps
- Arrow keys and WASD controls
- Score tracking with localStorage high scores
- Progressive speed increase every 5 points
- Retro CRT-style CSS filters
- Mobile: touch swipe controls
- Sound effects via Web Audio API

Start building — I want to play in 20 minutes.
```

**What it demonstrates:**
- Frontend, audio, and input handling built in parallel
- Tester writes Playwright tests while game is under construction
- Fast iteration with visible progress across agents

---

### 4. Turn-by-Turn Text Adventure Engine

```
Text-based adventure engine in TypeScript:
- Load worlds from JSON (rooms, items, NPCs, transitions)
- Command parser: go [dir], look, take [item], use [item] on [target], talk to [npc], inventory
- Sample adventure: 10 rooms, 5 items, 3 NPCs, 2 puzzles
- Save/load game state to JSON
- Terminal via Node.js with colored output (chalk)
- Narrator voice: descriptions vary by inventory/actions

Build engine and sample adventure simultaneously. Content writer and engine builder work in parallel.
```

**What it demonstrates:**
- Natural split between engine logic and content creation
- Both streams run fully in parallel with shared data format decisions
- Tester writes test cases from spec before implementation completes

---

### 5. Arcane Duel — A Card Battle Game

```
Strategic card duel game (browser, inspired by MTG):
- 30+ cards across 4 types: Attack, Defense, Spell, Trap (with mana cost, power, toughness, effects)
- Turn phases: Draw → Main → Combat → End
- Mana system: +1 per turn (max 10), some cards generate bonus mana
- Stack-based spell resolution
- HP: 20 each, win at 0
- AI opponent with basic strategy
- HTML/CSS grid battlefield showing fields, hands, graveyards
- Card hover preview

One agent designs cards/balance, another builds engine/rules, another builds UI, tester validates combat math. Go.
```

**What it demonstrates:**
- Deep parallelism requiring early data format alignment via decisions.md
- UI scaffolding proceeds while card design is underway
- Scribe's decision propagation becomes critical (mana curve affects engine and AI)

### Squad Blog Engine (Meta Demo)

```
Static blog engine rendering markdown posts to HTML (no frameworks):

Input: docs/blog/ markdown with YAML frontmatter (title, date, author, wave, tags, status, hero).

Output:
- Index page: posts sorted by date, with title/hero/author/tags
- Post pages: clean typography, syntax-highlighted code, responsive tables
- Tag index grouping posts by tag
- Wave navigation: ← Previous | Next → links
- Dark mode toggle (CSS custom properties, localStorage)
- RSS feed (feed.xml)

Design: Clean, modern, developer-focused. Monospace headings, proportional body. Dark code blocks with copy button. Mobile responsive. Fast — no JS for reading (JS only for dark mode and copy).

Build parser, template engine, RSS generator, static output (dist/). Include `node build.js` script. Set up team and build in one session.
```

**What it demonstrates:**
- Meta-demo where Squad builds its own publishing tool
- All components (parser, templating, RSS, CSS) build in parallel
- Finished product is visual, functional, and self-documenting

---

## Mid-Size Projects

Real coordination needed. Agents make architectural decisions, share them, and build across multiple rounds.

---

### 6. Cloud-Native E-Commerce Store

```
Build an event-driven e-commerce store:
- Product Catalog API (Node.js/Express, PostgreSQL) — CRUD + search
- Order Service (Node.js) — async processing via message queue, payment stubs, events
- Notification Service — listens for order events, emails confirmations
- API Gateway — auth (JWT), rate limiting
- RabbitMQ or in-memory stub for local dev
- React SPA: product grid, cart, checkout

Each service with its own Dockerfile. Include docker-compose.yml. Orders return 202 Accepted, status polled/pushed via WebSocket.

Set up a team. One agent per service. Coordinate on API contracts and event schemas early, then build in parallel.
```

**What it demonstrates:**
- True microservice parallelism with contract-first coordination
- Event schema decisions must propagate early via Scribe
- API gateway scaffolds while downstream services build independently

---

### 7. Playwright-Tested Dashboard App

```
Build a project management dashboard (React + TypeScript, Node.js/Express):
- Kanban board with drag-and-drop (Backlog, In Progress, Review, Done)
- Task creation: title, description, assignee, priority, due date
- Filtering by assignee, priority, status
- Real-time updates via WebSocket
- User auth: login/signup (JWT, bcrypt)
- SQLite + Drizzle ORM

Full Playwright test suite covering login, CRUD, drag-and-drop, filtering, real-time sync (two browser contexts). Write Gherkin feature files FIRST, then implement Playwright step definitions. Runnable with `npx playwright test`.

Set up the team. Write Gherkin specs and test skeletons before implementation starts, update as UI takes shape.
```

**What it demonstrates:**
- Test-first development with Gherkin specs written before implementation
- Frontend and backend build in parallel while tests scaffold
- Anticipatory work pattern: tests and implementation converge without blocking

---

### 8. GitHub Copilot Extension

```
Build a GitHub Copilot Chat extension (Copilot Extensions SDK):
- Act as @code-reviewer agent
- Accept GitHub repo URL or PR number
- Fetch diff via GitHub API, analyze for security (SQL injection, XSS, secrets), performance (N+1 queries), style violations (configurable .code-reviewer.yml)
- Return structured feedback with file-level annotations
- Blackbeard-style SSE streaming response
- Deploy as Vercel serverless function
- Include GitHub App manifest

Read SDK docs carefully. One agent owns SDK integration/streaming, another owns analysis engine, another owns GitHub API. Set up the team.
```

**What it demonstrates:**
- Agents read external SDK docs and build to prescribed patterns
- SDK integration and analysis engine work in parallel with shared interface contract
- Real-world API integration with deployment considerations

---

### 9. Aspire Cloud-Native App

```
Build a cloud-native app with Aspire (read https://aspire.dev/):

- User Preferences service: stores cities (PostgreSQL)
- Background Worker: refreshes cache every 15 minutes
- Service discovery via Aspire (no hardcoded URLs)
- Health checks and OpenTelemetry tracing

Team organized by Aspire integration: AppHost/discovery, Redis caching, PostgreSQL, Blazor frontend, background worker. Tester validates service discovery and end-to-end data flow. Set up the team.
```

**What it demonstrates:**
- Agents specialized by infrastructure component rather than traditional roles
- AppHost coordinates wiring while service agents build independently
- Infrastructure decisions (service names, connection strings) propagate via decisions.md

---

## Large Projects

Complex coordination, memory, and team size. Multiple rounds, cross-cutting decisions, agents remember earlier work.
