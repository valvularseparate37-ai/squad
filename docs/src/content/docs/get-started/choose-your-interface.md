# Choose your interface
Squad works across multiple interfaces. Pick the one that fits your workflow.

---
## Try this:
```bash
# Day-to-day work with your squad
copilot --agent squad
# Setup and diagnostics
squad init
squad doctor
```

---
## What are the ways to use Squad?
Squad runs in multiple modes and across multiple platforms:
### GitHub Copilot CLI (`copilot` command)
The conversational terminal interface. Powered by the GitHub Copilot CLI, this is the recommended way to work with Squad day-to-day.
```bash
copilot --agent squad
```
Reads `.squad/` and uses `squad.agent.md` to coordinate your team. Full feature set — sub-agent spawning, per-spawn model selection, background execution, SQL tools, parallel fan-out.
### VS Code (GitHub Copilot in the editor)
Squad works identically in VS Code through GitHub Copilot. Same `.squad/` directory, same agents, same decisions. Full file access, parallel execution, MCP tool inheritance. See [Squad in VS Code](../features/vscode.md) for details.
### Squad CLI (`squad` command)
The Squad CLI provides setup, diagnostics, and automation commands. Not conversational — use this for installation, validation, and operational tasks.
```bash
# Setup
squad init
# Validation
squad doctor
# Monitoring
squad watch
# Observability
squad aspire
```
See [CLI Reference](../reference/cli.md) for all commands.
### SDK (`@bradygaster/squad-sdk`)
Programmatic access for building tools on top of Squad. Typed APIs, routing config, agent lifecycle hooks.
```bash
npm install @bradygaster/squad-sdk
```
```typescript
import { resolveSquad, loadConfig, SquadCoordinator } from '@bradygaster/squad-sdk';
```
See [SDK Reference](../reference/sdk.md) for the complete API.
### Copilot Coding Agent (`@copilot`)
Background GitHub automation that picks up labeled issues and opens draft PRs. Works across your organization with human-defined guardrails. Issue gets labeled → agent picks it up → PR gets opened → human reviews.
See [Copilot Coding Agent](../features/copilot-coding-agent.md) for setup.

## Which should I use?

| You want to... | Use | Why |
|----------------|-----|-----|
| **Work with your squad day-to-day** | **GitHub Copilot CLI** or **VS Code** | Conversational interface, full agent spawning, parallel execution. Most natural way to collaborate with your team. |
| **Set up Squad in a new repo** | **Squad CLI** (`squad init`) | One command initializes `.squad/` directory and all configuration. |
| **Check if Squad is working** | **Squad CLI** (`squad doctor`) | Validates directory structure, agents, configuration integrity. |
| **Monitor work 24/7** | **Squad CLI** (`squad watch`) | Persistent polling for new issues, auto-triage, agent assignment. |
| **View OpenTelemetry traces** | **Squad CLI** (`squad aspire`) | Launches Aspire dashboard for observability. |
| **Process approved issues in the background** | **Copilot Coding Agent** | GitHub Actions workflow watches for labeled issues and dispatches `@copilot`. |
| **Build tools on top of Squad** | **SDK** | Typed APIs, configuration loading, agent lifecycle hooks. |

| Background execution | ✅ | ⚠️ (parallel sync) | ✅ | ✅ |
| SQL tool | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Aspire dashboard | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| `squad doctor` diagnostics | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Issue assignment to `@copilot` | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ (setup) | ❌ |

**Legend:**

## Common workflows
### "I use GitHub Copilot CLI for everything"
```bash
# Terminal 1: Work with Squad
copilot --agent squad
# Let Squad call `squad` commands when needed (doctor, watch, aspire)
```
This is the recommended workflow. The CLI automatically invokes Squad CLI commands when needed.
### "I run squad watch in one terminal and use GitHub Copilot CLI in another"
```bash
# Terminal 1: Monitoring (persistent)
squad watch --interval 10
# Terminal 2: Work with Squad
copilot --agent squad
```
Keep Ralph monitoring issues in the background while you work conversationally.
### "I use VS Code with Copilot for coding and Squad CLI for setup"
```bash
# One-time setup
squad init
squad doctor
# Open VS Code, select Squad from agent picker
# Same .squad/ directory, same team
```
Initialize with CLI, work in VS Code.
