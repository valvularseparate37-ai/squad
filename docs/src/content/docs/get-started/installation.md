# Installation
Three ways to get Squad running. Pick the one that fits.

---
## Try this:
```bash
npm install -g @bradygaster/squad-cli
squad --version
```
That's it. You're in.

---
## 1. CLI (Recommended)
The CLI is the fastest way to use Squad from any terminal.
### Global install
```bash
npm install -g @bradygaster/squad-cli
```
Now use it anywhere:
```bash
squad init
squad status
squad watch
```
### One-off with npx
No install needed — run the latest version directly:
```bash
npx @bradygaster/squad-cli init
npx @bradygaster/squad-cli status
```
### Verify
```bash
squad --version
```
### Update
```bash
npm install -g @bradygaster/squad-cli@latest
```

## Which method should I use?
Pick based on what you're doing:

| **You want to...** | **Use** | **Why** |
|--------------------|---------|---------|
| Try Squad quickly | **CLI** with `npx` | No install needed. Run `npx @bradygaster/squad-cli init` and you're testing it. |
| Use Squad across all projects | **CLI** with `--global` | One install. Works everywhere. Run `squad` from any terminal. |
| Work inside VS Code | **VS Code** (just open your project) | Already using Copilot? Squad just works. Same `.squad/` directory as CLI. |
| Build tools on top of Squad | **SDK** | Typed APIs, routing config, agent lifecycle hooks. Programmatic access to everything. |

Can't decide? → Start with **CLI**. You can always add VS Code or the SDK later. Your `.squad/` directory works identically everywhere.

---
## 2. VS Code
Squad works in VS Code through GitHub Copilot. Your `.squad/` directory works identically in both CLI and VS Code — same agents, same decisions, same memory.
> **Tip:** Initialize your team with the CLI (`squad`), then open the project in VS Code to keep working with the same squad.

---
## 3. SDK
Building your own tooling on top of Squad? Install the SDK as a project dependency:
```bash
npm install @bradygaster/squad-sdk
```
Then import what you need:
```typescript
import { defineConfig, loadConfig, resolveSquad } from '@bradygaster/squad-sdk';
```
The SDK gives you typed configuration, routing, model selection, and the full agent lifecycle API. See the [SDK Reference](../reference/sdk.md) for details.

---
## First-Time Setup
After installing, initialize Squad in your project:
```bash
cd your-project
squad init
```
This creates:
```
.github/agents/squad.agent.md  — coordinator agent
.squad/                        — team state directory
```
### Configuration (optional)
For typed configuration, create a `squad.config.ts` at your project root:
```typescript
import { defineConfig } from '@bradygaster/squad-sdk';
export default defineConfig({
  team: {
    name: 'my-squad',
    root: '.squad',
    description: 'My project team',
  },
});
```
`defineConfig()` gives you full autocomplete and validation. But you don't need it to get started — Squad works out of the box with sensible defaults.

---
## Troubleshooting
### `squad: command not found`
Your npm global bin isn't in your PATH. Fix:
```bash
# Check if installed
npm list -g @bradygaster/squad-cli
# If installed but not found, check PATH:
echo $PATH | grep npm          # macOS/Linux
echo %PATH% | findstr npm      # Windows
```
### `Cannot find .squad/ directory`
Run `squad init` in your project root to create your Squad files.
### Version mismatch between CLI and SDK
Update both:
```bash
npm install -g @bradygaster/squad-cli@latest
npm install @bradygaster/squad-sdk@latest
```
