# Quick start
Your first 5 minutes with Squad. Prove it works before you learn anything.

---
## Prerequisites
- **Node.js 20+** — Check with `node --version`
- **Git repository** — New or existing

---
## Install
```bash
npm install --save-dev @bradygaster/squad-cli
```
Then initialize:
```bash
npx squad init
```
You'll see:
```
✅ Squad installed.
   .github/agents/squad.agent.md — coordinator agent
   .squad/templates/ — 11 template files
Open GitHub Copilot and select Squad from the agent list.
```

---
## Validate
Check that Squad created your team directory:
```bash
ls .squad/
```
You should see: `team.md`, `routing.md`, `decisions.md`, `agents/`, and more.
Confirm Squad is ready:
```bash
npx squad status
```

---
## Try it
Open GitHub Copilot in your terminal or VS Code. Select **Squad** from the agent list (`/agent Squad` in CLI or `/agents` in VS Code).
Say something simple:
```
> I'm building a task management app with React and Node.js.
> Users can create, update, and delete tasks.
```
Squad forms your team and responds with agent names and roles. Say yes, or just give your first task:
```
> Team, create a basic Express server with a /health endpoint.
```
Squad spawns agents and moves the work forward.

---
## What just happened?
Squad read your description, formed a team of specialists, wrote their charters to `.squad/agents/`, and coordinated parallel work. Check `.squad/decisions.md` to see what they decided.
