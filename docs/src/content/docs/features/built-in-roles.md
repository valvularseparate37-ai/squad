# Built-in Base Roles

## Overview

- Squad ships with 20 curated base roles covering software development and business operations.
- Base roles provide deep, substantive charter content out of the box — no LLM generation needed.
- During team casting, base roles serve as starting points that get refined for your project context.
- Role content is adapted from [agency-agents](https://github.com/msitarzewski/agency-agents) by AgentLand Contributors (MIT License).

## Why Base Roles?

- **Faster setup** — deterministic role selection instead of LLM improvisation.
- **Lower token cost** — base content provides 90% of the charter; only project-specific refinement needs the LLM.
- **Higher quality** — curated expertise, boundaries, and voice instead of generic boilerplate.
- **Broad coverage** — not just software dev; marketing, sales, product, game dev, and more.

| Emoji | ID | Title | Vibe |
|-------|----|-------|------|
| 🏗️ | `lead` | Lead / Architect | Designs systems that survive the team that built them. Every decision has a trade-off — name it. |
| ⚛️ | `frontend` | Frontend Developer | Builds responsive, accessible web apps with pixel-perfect precision. |
| 🔧 | `backend` | Backend Developer | Designs the systems that hold everything up — databases, APIs, cloud, scale. |
| 💻 | `fullstack` | Full-Stack Developer | Sees the full picture — from the database to the pixel. |
| 👁️ | `reviewer` | Code Reviewer | Reviews code like a mentor, not a gatekeeper. Every comment teaches something. |

| ⚙️ | `devops` | DevOps Engineer | Automates infrastructure so your team ships faster and sleeps better. |
| 🔒 | `security` | Security Engineer | Models threats, reviews code, and designs security architecture that actually holds. |
| 📊 | `data` | Data Engineer | Thinks in tables and queries. Normalizes first, denormalizes when the numbers demand it. |
| 📝 | `docs` | Technical Writer | Turns complexity into clarity. If the docs are wrong, the product is wrong. |
| 🤖 | `ai` | AI / ML Engineer | Builds intelligent systems that learn, reason, and adapt. |
| 🎨 | `designer` | UI/UX Designer | Pixel-aware and user-obsessed. If it looks off by one, it is off by one. |
| 🔍 | `fact-checker` | Fact Checker | Trust, but verify. Every claim gets a source check before it ships. |

## Customization
