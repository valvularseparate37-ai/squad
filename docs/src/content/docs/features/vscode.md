# Squad in VS Code

> ⚠️ **Experimental** — Squad is alpha software. APIs, commands, and behavior may change between releases.


Squad is fully supported in VS Code (v0.4.0+). Your team runs identically to the CLI, with the same `.squad/` state, same agents, same decisions — but with VS Code-specific tooling and constraints.

This guide covers what's different, what's the same, and when to use CLI vs VS Code.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **VS Code** — Latest version
- **GitHub Copilot extension** — `GitHub.copilot` (installed, authenticated)
- **Workspace trust** — Your workspace must be trusted (VS Code security)
- **Node.js 20+ (LTS)** — If running CLI to initialize Squad
- **Squad installed** — Either in the repo already (from CLI), or initialized fresh via agent selection

### Initial Setup

**Option A: Initialize with CLI (recommended)**

```bash
npm install -g @bradygaster/squad-cli
```

Creates `.github/agents/squad.agent.md` and `.squad/templates/`. Then open VS Code and select **Squad** from the agent picker.

**Option B: Fresh in VS Code**

Open Copilot in VS Code, select **Squad** from `/agents`. Squad detects it's running in VS Code and bootstraps normally. The `.squad/` directory is created on first run.

---

## How It Works

Squad detects VS Code automatically and adapts its spawning mechanism:

- **In CLI:** Uses `task` tool with full control (model selection, agent type, background mode)
- **In VS Code:** Uses `runSubagent` for **parallel synchronous execution**

When you assign work to an agent, the coordinator spawns that agent as a sub-agent in VS Code. Multiple sub-agents spawn in **the same turn** run in **parallel**. Each completes, then you get all results at once — no intermediate "launch table" feedback like CLI shows.

---

## What's Different from CLI

### No Per-Spawn Model Selection

VS Code accepts the session model (your Copilot model picker). No per-spawn dynamic selection. Cost optimization deferred — use Haiku via model picker for cheaper runs.

### Sub-Agents Run Sync (But Parallel)

Agents launch in the same turn and run in parallel, but block as a group. Results arrive all at once — no launch table or `read_agent` polling.

### SQL Tool Not Available

SQL unavailable in VS Code agents. Workflows needing SQL should live in CLI, or use file-based state (JSON in `.squad/state/`).

### File Writes May Prompt for Approval

VS Code security feature: approve file modifications once with "Always allow in this workspace".

---

## What's the Same

### Same `.squad/` State

Initialize in CLI, use in VS Code, or vice versa. Team roster, decisions, histories are identical across both.

### Same Team, Same Skills

Charters, histories, agent roles persist. Decisions made in CLI are visible in VS Code.

### Parallel Execution Works

Multiple agents in one turn → all run in parallel. Equivalent throughput to CLI background mode.

### Full File Access (Workspace-Scoped)

Read/write your entire workspace and `.squad/` directory. Cannot reach outside workspace.

### MCP Tools Inherited

If workspace has MCP servers configured, sub-agents inherit them (GitHub MCP, semantic search, terminal).

---

## Tips

Use single-root workspaces (multi-root has path resolution bugs).

Accept file modification approval once — subsequent writes are automatic.

For initial setup, heavy parallel work (5+ agents), SQL workflows, or cost optimization (per-spawn model selection) → use CLI.

Check the model picker at top of chat if agents seem slow or expensive — switch to Haiku for cost savings.

---

## Known Limitations

- **JetBrains IDEs** — Untested. Agent spawning mechanism undocumented.
- **GitHub.com (web)** — Untested. Copilot Chat on GitHub.com doesn't support Squad.
- **Custom agent model selection** — Phase 2 future feature.

See [Getting Started](../get-started/first-session.md) for your first VS Code session.

---

## Default Chat Session Mode

When you run `squad init`, Squad automatically configures VS Code to open new chat
sessions in Squad mode by adding the following to `.vscode/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "chat.newSession.defaultMode": "Squad"
}
```

**Behavior:**

- If `.vscode/settings.json` does not exist, Squad creates it (and the `.vscode/` directory
  if needed) with this single setting.
- If the file already exists and `chat.newSession.defaultMode` is absent, Squad adds the key
  while preserving all existing settings, comments, and formatting (JSONC-safe edit).
- If `chat.newSession.defaultMode` already has **any** value, Squad leaves it untouched —
  your setting always takes precedence.
- The operation is **idempotent**: running `squad init` again produces no changes.

**Opt out:**

Pass `--no-vscode-default` to skip this step entirely:

```bash
squad init --no-vscode-default
```

With this flag, Squad will not create or modify `.vscode/settings.json` at all.

---

## Extension Developer Guide

If you're building a VS Code extension that integrates with Squad, follow these patterns.

### Detect Client Mode

```typescript
const isVSCodeMode = process.env.SQUAD_CLIENT === 'vscode';

if (!isVSCodeMode) {
  console.warn('SquadUI should only run in VS Code');
  return;
}
```

### Import SDK Safely

**DO:** Import specific types and functions

```typescript
import type { CastMember, AgentCharter } from '@bradygaster/squad-sdk';
import { loadConfig, resolveSquad } from '@bradygaster/squad-sdk';
```

**DON'T:** Import the CLI entry point — this will call `process.exit()` and crash your extension.

### Load Configuration

```typescript
import { loadConfig, resolveSquad } from '@bradygaster/squad-sdk';

try {
  const squadPath = resolveSquad(workspaceRoot);
  const config = await loadConfig(squadPath);
  console.log('Squad loaded:', config.team.name);
} catch (err) {
  console.warn('Squad not found:', err.message);
  return;
}
```

### Spawn Agents

```typescript
import { SquadCoordinator } from '@bradygaster/squad-sdk';

const coordinator = new SquadCoordinator({ teamRoot: squadPath });
await coordinator.initialize();

const decision = await coordinator.route('refactor this function');
await coordinator.execute(decision, 'refactor this function');
```

### Stream Responses

```typescript
import { startStreaming } from '@bradygaster/squad-sdk';

const stream = await startStreaming(agentResponse);
for await (const chunk of stream) {
  vscodePanel.append(chunk);
}
```

### Handle Errors Gracefully

```typescript
try {
  const result = await coordinator.route(userTask);
} catch (err) {
  vscode.window.showErrorMessage(`Squad error: ${err.message}`);
}
```

Never call `process.exit()` in an extension — it crashes VS Code.

### Pass Editor Context

```typescript
const editor = vscode.window.activeTextEditor;

const decision = await coordinator.route(userTask, {
  fileContent: editor.document.getText(),
  fileName: editor.document.fileName,
  selection: editor.selection,
  language: editor.document.languageId,
});
```
