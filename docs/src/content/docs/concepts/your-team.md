# Your Team
Squad builds you a team of AI specialists that live in your repo. Tell it what you're working on, and it proposes a roster — backend devs, testers, writers, a lead — each with their own personality, expertise, and memory. Your team grows smarter every session.

---
## Try This
```
Set up a team for a React + Node.js API with PostgreSQL
```
```
Fenster, fix the login validation bug
```
```
Add a security specialist to the team
```

---
## How It Works
When you first run Squad in a repository, it walks through a four-step init flow:
```mermaid
graph LR
    A["Discovery<br/>scan repo<br/>detect stack"]
    B["Proposal<br/>3-7 member<br/>roster"]
    C["Confirmation<br/>accept, add<br/>remove, tweak"]
    D["Creation<br/>write files<br/>install crew"]
    
    A --> B
    B --> C
    C --> D
```
1. **Discovery** — Squad scans your repo: languages, file structure, test frameworks, dependencies, existing workflows.
2. **Proposal** — It suggests a roster with 3–7 members tailored to what it found.
3. **Confirmation** — You review and customize: accept as-is, add roles, remove roles, rename members.
4. **Creation** — Squad writes the `.squad/` directory, creates charters, and sets up the coordinator.

### Default Team Composition

| Role | When Included |
|------|--------------|
| **Lead** | Always — triages, reviews, unblocks |
| **Core Dev** | Always — main implementation |
| **Tester** | If tests exist or test deps detected |
| **DevRel** | If README exists or `docs/` present |
| **Frontend** | If React/Vue/Svelte/Angular detected |
| **Backend** | If API routes, database code, or server framework detected |
| **Scribe** | Always — silent decision logger |

---
## Human Team Members
Not every team member needs to be AI. Add real people for decisions that need a human — design sign-off, security review, product approval.
```
Add Sarah as design reviewer
```
Sarah appears on the roster with a 👤 Human badge.

| | AI Agent | Human Member |
|---|----------|-------------|
| Badge | Role-specific emoji | 👤 Human |
| Charter | ✅ | ❌ |
| History | ✅ | ❌ |
| Spawned as sub-agent | ✅ | ❌ |
| Can review work | ✅ | ✅ |

When work routes to a human, Squad **pauses** and tells you someone needs to act. You relay the task outside of Squad, then report back what happened. Stale reminders keep things moving.
Not sure whether someone should be a roster member or just a normal GitHub collaborator? See [When to add a human member](../features/human-team-members.md#when-to-add-a-human-member) for a decision framework.

---
## Work Routing
The coordinator routes work automatically using three strategies. First match wins:

| Strategy | How It Works | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Named** | You say who does it | `"Fenster, fix the login bug"` |
| **Domain** | Pattern matching in `.squad/routing.md` | `src/api/**` → Backend |
| **Skill-aware** | Capability check in `.copilot/skills/` | Auth expertise → Backend or Lead |

**Routing priority:** Named > Domain > Skill-aware. If nothing matches, the Lead triages.

### Sample Routing Table
```markdown
| Pattern | Owner | Reason |
|---------|-------|--------|
| `src/api/**` | Backend | API implementation |
| `src/components/**/*.tsx` | Frontend | React components |
| `*.test.ts` | Tester | Test files |
| `docs/**` | DevRel | Documentation |

```
GitHub issues with `squad:{member}` labels route directly — `squad:fenster` goes to Fenster, no triage needed.
### Multi-Agent Work
Some tasks need multiple agents:
```
Fenster, implement the API. Hockney, write the tests.
```
The coordinator spawns both in parallel. They work independently and coordinate through shared `.squad/` state. See [Parallel Work & Models](parallel-work.md) for details.

---
## Reviewer Protocol
When a reviewer (Lead, Tester) rejects work, the original agent gets **locked out** — no self-revision allowed. This prevents endless fix-retry loops.
```
Agent A writes code → Lead rejects → Agent A locked out
  → Coordinator reassigns to Agent B or escalates to you
```

| Outcome | What Happens |
|---------|-------------|
| **Approve** | PR merges, issue closes, agent unlocked |
| **Request changes** | Author locked out, work reassigned or escalated |

### Lockout Details
- **Task-specific** — locked out of that PR/issue, not all work
- **Session-persistent** — survives restarts (stored in `.squad/orchestration-log/`)
- **Clearable** — `"Unlock Fenster for issue #42"`
### Reviewer Authority

| Reviewer | Scope |
|----------|-------|
| **Lead** | Code quality, architecture, security — all submissions |
| **Tester** | Correctness, test coverage — test-related changes |
| **You** | Final arbiter — can override any decision |

### Deadlock Handling
If all capable agents are locked out, the coordinator escalates to you with options: manual fix, unlock with guidance, or close as won't-fix.

---
## Ceremonies
Structured team meetings that trigger at key moments — automatically or on demand.

| Ceremony | Auto-Triggers When | What Happens |
|----------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Design Review** | Multi-agent task with 2+ agents modifying shared systems | Lead facilitates; agents weigh in on interfaces, risks, contracts |
| **Retrospective** | Build failures, test failures, reviewer rejections | Lead runs root-cause analysis; decisions written to `decisions.md` |

Run either manually anytime:

```
Run a design review before we start the authentication rebuild
```
You can also create custom ceremonies, disable auto-triggers, or skip a ceremony for a single task. Config lives in `.squad/ceremonies.md`.

---
## Response Modes
Squad auto-selects the right level of effort for each request:

| Mode | Time | What Happens | Triggered By |
|------|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Direct** | ~2–3s | Coordinator answers from memory, no agent spawned | Status checks, factual questions |
| **Lightweight** | ~8–12s | One agent, minimal prompt — skips charter/history/decisions | Small fixes, typos, quick follow-ups |
| **Standard** | ~25–35s | Full agent spawn with charter, history, and decisions | Normal work requests |
| **Full** | ~40–60s | Multi-agent parallel spawn, may trigger design review | Complex multi-domain tasks |

**Pro tip:** `"Team, ..."` prompts trigger Full mode. Named agent prompts (`"Kane, ..."`) trigger Standard. Quick questions get Direct automatically.

---
## Customizing After Init

| What You Say | What Happens |
|--------------|-------------|
| `"Add a database specialist"` | Coordinator casts a new member, creates charter, updates routing |
| `"Remove McManus from the team"` | Archives agent directory to `.squad/agents/.archived/`, updates team.md |
| `"Change the tester to focus on integration tests"` | Updates the tester's charter and expertise |
| `"Route all CSS files to Frontend"` | Adds a rule to `.squad/routing.md` |
| `"From now on, McManus reviews all docs before merge"` | Creates routing rule + [directive](../features/memory.md) |

Running `init` on an existing Squad repo automatically offers upgrade mode.

---
## Planning your team
Before running `squad init`, think through these decisions. Squad will scan your repo and propose a team — having answers ready makes setup faster.
- **What does your project do?** Have a 1–2 sentence description of the language, stack, and purpose ready — Squad uses this to pick roles
- **What roles do you need?** The [default composition](#default-team-composition) covers common cases, or let Squad propose custom roles based on your repo
- **How many agents?** Typical teams are 3–7 agents. Scribe (memory) is always included
- **Will humans join the team?** [Human members](#human-team-members) can serve as reviewers or domain experts alongside AI agents
- **Will @copilot participate?** The GitHub Copilot coding agent can pick up approved issues in the background — see [Agent anatomy](#agent-anatomy)
- **How will you track work?** GitHub Issues with `squad:{member}` labels, or conversational tasking via named prompts
- **Do you want review gates?** [Reviewers](#reviewer-protocol) can approve or reject work before it proceeds
- **What ceremonies matter?** [Design reviews and retrospectives](#ceremonies) can auto-trigger or run on demand
- **What model preferences?** Default is automatic selection, or specify preferred models per agent — see [Parallel Work & Models](parallel-work.md)
- **How many squads, and where do they live?** One squad per repo is the default — your `.squad/` directory lives alongside your code. For multi-repo projects, start with one squad per repo, then use linked team roots, exports, or upstream inheritance when you need shared context.

---
## Agent anatomy
An agent is a directory at `.squad/agents/{name}/`. The contents depend on the member type.
For how humans differ from AI agents, see [Human team members](#human-team-members) above.

| | @copilot (🤖) |
|---|---|
| Directory | None |
| `charter.md` | ❌ Uses `copilot-instructions.md` |
| `history.md` | ❌ |
| Spawnable | ❌ Works via issue assignment |

**AI agents** have a `charter.md` (identity, expertise, voice — compiled into the system prompt at spawn time) and an optional `history.md` (append-only cross-session learnings).
**@copilot** (🤖) appears on the roster and works via GitHub issue assignment. It reads `.github/copilot-instructions.md` instead of a charter.
**Retired agents** move to `.squad/agents/_alumni/{name}/` — charter preserved as a read-only archive, not spawnable.

---
## Cross-agent context
Agents don't share memory directly. Context flows through explicit shared files:
- **`team.md`** — who's on the team and what they do
- **`routing.md`** — work assignment rules the coordinator reads on every request
- **`decisions.md`** — canonical team memory: directives, patterns, learnings
- **`.squad/decisions/inbox/`** — agents drop decision files here; the Scribe merges them into `decisions.md`
Each agent's `history.md` is personal — only that agent reads it at spawn time. For the full picture on knowledge flow, see [Memory and knowledge](../features/memory.md).

---
## Hiring an agent
To add a new AI agent to your team:
- [ ] Create `.squad/agents/{name}/` directory
- [ ] Write `charter.md` — start from `.squad/templates/charter.md`
- [ ] Add to `team.md` roster with status `✅ Active`
- [ ] Add to `routing.md` with work type assignments
- [ ] (Optional) Create `history.md` for persistent memory
- [ ] (Optional) Allocate a name via the casting system
To add a **human member**, skip the directory — just add them to `team.md`. See [Human team members](#human-team-members) for badge and routing details.

---
## Tips
- **Commit `.squad/`** to version control — anyone who clones the repo gets the full team with all accumulated knowledge.
- Use human members for approval gates: design review, compliance, final sign-off.
- Design reviews prevent agents from building conflicting implementations — let them run on multi-agent tasks.
- Retros produce [decisions](../features/memory.md) that improve future work, not just diagnose the current failure.
- You're the relay for human members. Squad can't message them directly — it tells you, and you coordinate.
