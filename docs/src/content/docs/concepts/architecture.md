## Components
### Coordinator
The coordinator is Squad's routing engine. It reads your request, checks routing rules in `.squad/routing.md`, and decides which agents to spawn. If you say "team," it decomposes the work and launches multiple agents in parallel. If you name an agent, it routes directly to them.
### Agents
Each agent is a specialist with a charter, role, and persistent memory. Agents are spawned as independent subprocesses with their own context windows and tools. They read `.squad/decisions.md` and their own history before working, then write results back. Agents never see each other's conversations — the coordinator orchestrates coordination.
### Memory (.squad/)
All team state lives in `.squad/`. This includes the roster (`team.md`), routing rules (`routing.md`), decisions (`decisions.md`), agent charters and histories (`agents/`), and ceremony schedules (`ceremonies.md`). Agents read this before every spawn. You own these files — edit them anytime.
### Routing
Routing rules in `.squad/routing.md` define which agent handles which work. The coordinator reads these rules before spawning. You can override routing by naming an agent directly in your request.
### Scribe
The Scribe is a silent agent that tracks decisions and logs sessions. Every team has a Scribe. You never talk to them directly — they work in the background, merging decisions from all agents into `.squad/decisions.md`.
### Ralph
Ralph is the work monitor. He watches your GitHub or GitLab issues, tracks work in progress, and alerts the team when something is ready. Every team has a Ralph. He's silent unless you ask him for status.

## What happens when you say "Team, build X"?
1. **Coordinator reads the request** and checks `.squad/routing.md` for decomposition rules.
2. **Coordinator spawns multiple agents in parallel** — one for frontend, one for backend, one for tests, etc.
3. **Each agent reads `.squad/decisions.md`** and their own history (`agents/{name}/history.md`), then works independently.
4. **Agents write results** to their history files and propose decisions.
5. **Scribe merges all decisions** into `.squad/decisions.md`.
6. **Coordinator returns labeled results** to you, tagged with each agent's name.
