# New Docs Site: Built by the Community
> _Squad's documentation site has been completely rebuilt from the ground up. A full Astro-powered docs experience with search, responsive design, and content contributed by multiple community members._

## What Shipped
### Complete Astro Docs Rewrite
[@IEvangelist](https://github.com/IEvangelist) (David Pine) delivered a **complete documentation site rebuild** in PR #293. This isn't a reskin — it's a ground-up rewrite:
- **Astro 5.7** — Static site generation with component islands
- **Tailwind CSS 4.1** — Modern utility-first styling with responsive design
- **Pagefind** — Client-side full-text search across all docs
- **Structured content** — Markdown content collections with frontmatter validation
- **Blog system** — All existing blog posts migrated into the new architecture
- **Custom components** — Sidebar with scroll-to-active, syntax-highlighted code blocks, callout boxes
The site ships as a static build under `docs/` with its own `package.json`. Dev server: `npm run dev`. Production build: `astro build && pagefind`.
### Docs Navigation Polish — PR #298
[@IEvangelist](https://github.com/IEvangelist) (David Pine) followed up with targeted improvements in PR #298:
- **Active link highlighting** — Docs and Blog links now highlight in the top navigation when you're viewing that section
- **Favicon fixes** — Favicon asset handling improved for all browsers
- **Navigation clarity** — Users now have better visual feedback about where they are in the docs
This was a fast-follow polish pass on the Astro rewrite, catching the details that make navigation feel solid.
### Community Content from @diberry
[@diberry](https://github.com/diberry) (Dina Berry) submitted **four pull requests** improving the getting-started experience:
- **PR #286** — Added validation steps to the Quick Start README
- **PR #288** — "Which method should I use?" decision tree for the installation page — CLI, VS Code, or SDK, with clear guidance on when to use each
- **PR #290** — ".squad/ directory explainer" for the first-session guide — a table showing every file and directory in `.squad/` with its purpose, plus ownership guidance
- **PR #292** — Doc-impact review process added to team workflows
All four contributions have been merged or ported into the new Astro docs structure.

## What Changed for Users
### Better Navigation
The sidebar now scrolls to your current position when a page loads. If you're deep in the table of contents, it stays where you are instead of jumping back to the top.
### Copilot CLI Callouts
Key pages now include callouts directing users to the **GitHub Copilot CLI** as the recommended interface:
```
💡 The recommended way to use Squad is through GitHub Copilot CLI:
copilot --agent squad
```
### CI/CD Safety Warnings
The CI/CD integration page now ships with the cron schedule **commented out by default** and a warning about GitHub Actions minutes consumption when enabling heartbeats and scheduled runs.
