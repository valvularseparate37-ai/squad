/**
 * Shared helper for resolving the `squad_state` MCP launch spec.
 *
 * Used by BOTH `squad init` and `squad upgrade` so the runtime-MCP fallback
 * behavior stays symmetric.
 *
 * Resolution order:
 *   0. If Squad is running from a standalone bundle (`SQUAD_STANDALONE_HOME`,
 *      exported by the bundle launcher) → spawn that bundle's launcher
 *      directly with an absolute path. This tier short-circuits *before* any
 *      registry probe, so a machine that cannot reach registry.npmjs.org
 *      never makes a network call here and never writes an `npx` spec it
 *      cannot execute later (#1593).
 *   1. Else if `cliVersion` IS published on npm → `npx -y <pkg>@<version>
 *      state-mcp` (clean cross-machine UX, the steady-state happy path).
 *   2. Else → `npx -y <pkg>@insider state-mcp`. We do NOT probe the registry;
 *      the `@insider` dist-tag is kept fresh by the publish flow and tier-2
 *      is the de-facto fallback whenever a pinned preview version isn't yet
 *      published. If it really isn't reachable at runtime, `npx` will fail
 *      loudly — same observable behavior as pre-iter-5.
 *
 * Iter-6 had two additional tiers (a local-install path resolver and a hard
 * error) that the smoke data showed never fired in practice: `@insider` is
 * always current, so tier-2 always wins before tier-3 is reached. Deleted
 * in iter-7 per the "verify you didn't add code that's no longer needed"
 * mandate.
