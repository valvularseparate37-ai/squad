/**
 * Archival integrity — make "move content between state files" incapable of
 * destroying that content.
 *
 * Archival is a two-half operation: append to a destination, then trim from a
 * source. Three production defects came from the halves coming apart:
 *
 * - #1774 — the trim ran and the append never did.
 * - #1783 — the append ran, but to an *untracked* destination. Under a
 *   git-excluded `.squad/`, already-tracked files still commit while brand-new
 *   files silently never do. The trim commits; the destination does not.
 *   Archival becomes deletion, and the reported outcome is success.
 * - #1760 — inbox bodies were spliced verbatim under `###` entries, landing
 *   `##` children beneath an `###` parent and breaking document hierarchy.
 *
 * The rules encoded here, in the order they must execute:
 *
 * 1. Assert the destination is git-tracked *before* writing to it.
 * 2. Append, verify the entries actually landed, and only then trim.
 * 3. Report entry counts, never file sizes. Size is not an integrity signal —
 *    a merge and an archive in the same pass can move a file's size in the
 *    wrong direction while both halves behave correctly.
 * 4. Demote inbox headings on merge so relative structure is preserved.
 * 5. Never report a gate outcome that was not measured.
 *
