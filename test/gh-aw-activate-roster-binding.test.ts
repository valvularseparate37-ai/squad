/**
 * Behavioral coverage for Team Guard Step TG-2 in `workflows/squad.md` (#1812).
 *
 * `/squad plan activate` minted `squad:{agent}` labels from the hardcoded
 * `squad init --preset default` roster (lead, reviewer, devrel, security, docs)
 * instead of this repository's real cast in `.squad/team.md`, and then printed a
 * provenance sentence claiming it had read `team.md` when it had not. On the
 * measured fixture (run 32471509974) the summary reported five preset names, none
 * of which appears anywhere in the fixture's `team.md`. A wrong answer wearing a
 * citation is worse than a wrong answer: refusal and correct binding are
 * indistinguishable from the outside, which is how #1784 got a false pass.
 *
 * More prose telling the model to "really read the file" had already been tried
 * repeatedly and failed. The fix is structural: TG-2 is a shell command whose
 * stdout survives the run and can be asserted against. These tests do exactly
 * that — they extract the bash block *declared* in the workflow and *execute* it
 * against real committed git repositories. Nothing here re-reads prose to confirm
 * prose. Every failure message names the offending input verbatim, because a
 * status-only assertion passes a truncating parser (measured on #1832).
