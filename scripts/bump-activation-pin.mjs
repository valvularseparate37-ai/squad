/**
 * Move the Squad CLI activation pin to a published standalone release (#1825).
 *
 * `.github/workflows/squad-cli-pin-drift.yml` verifies that the pin resolves to a
 * complete GitHub Release. This script keeps automated bumps compatible with the
 * release-tag format consumed by scripts/install.sh.
 *
 * It is a script rather than an inline `run:` block for two reasons. The patterns
 * below contain backticks (the docs table) and pipes (the YAML `||` fallback), both
 * of which are hostile to quoting inside a workflow block scalar — and as a file it
 * can be exercised by `test/squad-cli-pin.test.ts` without a release.
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT read `packages/squad-cli/package.json`. The caller supplies
 * a version it has already proven is published.
 *
 * Fails closed: if any pattern stops matching, the pin has moved and this script has
 * silently become a no-op. A bumper that cannot find its target must say so loudly,
 * or it reintroduces exactly the silent decay it exists to prevent.

 * when deciding whether the pin is current — a stale copy misinforms precisely the

 *
 * None of these patterns contain a literal `${`+`{` sequence, so the file stays safe
