## Plan Validation

### Result: ✅ PASS

### Checks

| Check | Status | Detail |
|-------|--------|--------|
| All tasks map to an epic | ✅ | 14/14 tasks traced to program epics |
| No circular dependencies | ✅ | Dependency graph is a valid DAG (topological sort succeeds) |
| Sizing within bounds (no >XL) | ✅ | Largest task is L (Task 12); no XL tasks |
| Agent assignments valid | ✅ | All agents (eecom, fido, control) are registered squad members |
| Scope boundary respected | ✅ | No tasks reference excluded items (Blazor, CI/CD, Cosmos DB) |
| No unresolved temporary IDs | ✅ | All task/epic references use final identifiers |
| Missing traceability | ✅ | Every implementation task traces to a program plan epic |
| Invalid hierarchy | ✅ | All epics have ≥1 user story; all stories have parent epics |
| Oversized work | ✅ | No tasks exceed max size L |
| Missing decisions | ✅ | Both triage decisions resolved (Table Storage selected; frontend deferred) |
| Incomplete metadata | ✅ | All tasks have size, agent, and epic assignment |
| Orphaned items | ✅ | All 16 triage work items represented in program plan |
| Milestone gaps | ✅ | All epics assigned to milestones; all milestones have ≥1 epic |
