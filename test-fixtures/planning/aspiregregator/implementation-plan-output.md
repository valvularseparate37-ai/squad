**Sizing key:** XS (<1h) · S (1–3h) · M (3–8h) · L (1–2d) · XL (2–5d)

### Rollout Order

1. **Phase 1 — Foundation (no dependencies):** Tasks 1, 2, 7
2. **Phase 2 — Grain Implementation:** Tasks 3, 4, 5, 6, 8
3. **Phase 3 — Platform & Persistence:** Tasks 9, 10, 11
4. **Phase 4 — Integration & Observability:** Tasks 12, 13, 14

### Risk Register

| Risk | Mitigation | Impact |
|------|------------|--------|
| Orleans 9.x serialization migration may break grain state deserialization | Write migration tests with serialized v7 state fixtures; validate round-trip | High — data loss if state can't deserialize |
| API rewiring (Task 12) is the largest task and touches all controllers | Contract tests (Task 1) run in CI; break early if contracts violated | Medium — regression risk |
| Azure Table Storage performance for high-cardinality grain keys | Benchmark with realistic grain count (10K+); partition key strategy review | Low — fallback to Cosmos DB if needed |
| .NET 9 breaking changes beyond Orleans serialization | Run full test suite after TFM upgrade before proceeding | Medium — blocks downstream tasks |

### GitHub Mapping

- **Issues:** One per task row (14 issues total)
- **Dependencies:** GitHub sub-issue relationships mirroring "Depends On" column
- **Milestones:**
  - `M1: Foundation & Safety Net` → Tasks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
  - `M2: Platform & Persistence` → Tasks 8, 9, 10, 11
  - `M3: Integration & Observability` → Tasks 12, 13, 14
- **Labels:** `size:S`, `size:M`, `size:L` + `squad` + `squad:{agent}` _(label mode — see README for size_representation note)_
