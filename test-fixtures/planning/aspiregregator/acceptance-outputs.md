- **Accepted by:** @bradygaster
- **Date:** 2026-07-15T14:22:00Z
- **Notes:** Confirmed scope with both decisions resolved — Azure Table Storage for grain persistence, Blazor frontend deferred. Three milestones over six weeks is acceptable timeline.

## Implementation Accepted

- **Implementation plan version:** #8 (comment-id: 2847456)
- **Validation result:** ✅ PASS (comment-id: 2847512)
- **Accepted by:** @bradygaster
- **Date:** 2026-07-15T14:35:00Z
- **Notes:** Task sizing looks right. The L-sized API rewiring task (Task 12) is the riskiest — contract tests in Phase 1 provide adequate safety net. Approved for activation.
