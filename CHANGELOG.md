# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.13.1] - 2026-08-26

### Fixed

- Allow runtime state tools to persist the casting policy, registry, and history keys required by the coordinator (`casting/policy.json`, `casting/registry.json`, and `casting/history.json`), while continuing to reject unrelated casting paths (#1876, #1898).

## [0.13.0] - 2026-08-25

This release is focused on hardening the gh-aw (Agentic Workflows) integration shipped in v0.12.0: the install contract, workflow router, plan lifecycle, dispatch reliability, and CI coverage are all tightened. It also adds `squad health`, fixes `squad watch`/`squad loop` externalized-state routing, fixes `squad nap` archival, and hardens the SDK's state and scheduler paths.

### Added

#### CLI
- `squad health` — new readiness diagnostics command; shared workflows can gate on environment readiness before running (#1877).
- `{prompt}` token in custom watch/loop agent commands as an unambiguous placement for the generated prompt; the existing `-p <prompt>` fallback is preserved (#1708).
- `squad doctor` now checks that every `eol=lf`-pinned file is actually LF on disk (not just in the index), names stale files, and points at `npm run fix:crlf`; closes #1793.
- Two stop signals for `squad watch`/`squad loop` previously parsed but never read — `--sentinel-file <path>` and `.squad/ralph-stop` — are now wired to the graceful shutdown path; closes #1711.
- Workflow files are now backed up before `squad upgrade` refreshes them (#1709).
- Shell detection now fails loudly instead of silently skipping when no POSIX shell resolves (#1857).

#### gh-aw / Agentic Workflows
- `feat(workflows): add advisory Squad reviewer` — a lightweight advisory review step added to the gh-aw workflow so plan output is reviewed before activation (#1871).
- Team Guard Step TG-2 — roster certification emitted into generated workflow output, letting an outer coordinator verify the cast is complete before dispatching (#1837).
- `squad-deps-worker` — a new fail-closed dependency-manifest worker that validates and routes dependency-update tasks; Wave 1 `protected-files.exclude` included (#1882, #1883, #1888).

#### SDK
- `feat(sdk): advertise real team capabilities in squad.agent.md` — a generated `Team Capabilities` block lists the actual cast, supported task types, and domain-to-agent routing hints; the block is rewritten on init, upgrade, and cast changes (#1881).
- `"max"` added to `SquadReasoningEffort` and `VALID_REASONING_EFFORTS` to match Copilot SDK 1.0.9 (#1693).

#### Release / distribution
- Activation pin drift guard: a daily CI job checks that the Squad CLI activation pin in gh-aw templates matches the latest published release and opens a PR when it drifts (#1855).
- Activation pin is now automatically updated when a new CLI version publishes (#1858).

### Changed

- (cli) Model catalog tiers and fallback routing updated for GPT-5.6 Sol, Terra, and Luna, and Gemini 3.1 Pro. Terra is the new default standard model for code and prompt tasks; Luna is its economy fallback (#1749, #1750).

### Fixed

#### gh-aw / Agentic Workflows — install and activation
- **`fix(gh-aw): preserve Squad CLI install contract`** — all four gh-aw workflow templates (`squad.yml`, `squad-cast.yml`, `squad-research.yml`, `squad-review.yml`) now install the Squad CLI *before* `gh aw install`, preventing `squad` from being absent when the `gh-aw` extension invokes it; this was the root cause of new-repo activation failures (#1887).
- `fix(gh-aw): bump activation CLI pin 0.11.0 → 0.12.0` for new-repo readiness (#1818).
- `ci: pin gh-aw v0.86.2 and add strict compile gate for all four workflows` — each workflow file is compiled and validated in CI; the compile job now non-skippably installs the gh-aw extension so the gate cannot be green-washed (#1886, #1775).

#### gh-aw / Agentic Workflows — router and dispatch
- `fix(gh-aw): fail loudly when /squad parses no command` — prevents a no-op silent run when the slash command payload is malformed (#1824, #1832).
- `fix(gh-aw): scan the first non-empty line in PC-0, not record 1` — fixes plan-coordinator step parsing for plans whose first line is blank (#1841).
- `fix(gh-aw): enforce activation agent bindings` — agent binding is now validated before an activation step is dispatched (#1865).
- `fix(gh-aw): bind squad:{agent} labels to each issue's own plan row` — labels were previously applied to the wrong issue row in multi-issue plans (#1863).
- `fix(gh-aw): stop the validation schema from shipping its own verdict` — schema self-reference loop that caused validation to always pass removed (#1853).
- `fix(gh-aw): refill dispatch slots from the root, not the parent epic` — epic dispatch slot exhaustion no longer blocks sibling dispatch (#1787).
- `fix(workflows): harden squad router` — router hardening pass: improved command parsing, guard conditions, and error reporting (#1868).
- `fix(workflows): harden implement relay provenance` — provenance metadata is now correctly threaded through the implement relay step (#1869).
- `fix(workflows): give plan validation adversarial teeth` — plan validation now checks for injection-style patterns and structural violations (#1870).
- `fix(dispatch): raise max to 2 and add schema static gate` — dispatch parallelism cap raised and enforced by a static schema check (#1772, #1777).
- `fix(gh-aw): refill dispatch slots from root` and long-path planning lifecycle defects corrected (#1778).
- Continuation dispatch inputs interpolated so merge continuation resolves the correct epic (#1741).
- Nested source files and package-registry egress now allowed in workflow scope (#1744).
- Protected writes fall back to a review issue instead of failing silently.
- Dispatch workflow schema probes prevented (#1766).
- `fix(squad.md): stop seeding Owner/Agent binding with the tokens it forbids` (#1789).
- `test(gh-aw): enforce dispatcher-first install order` — CI test asserts the install ordering contract is maintained (#1879).
- `test(gh-aw): enforce shell input security contract over compiled output` — compiled workflow output is scanned for unsafe input expansion patterns (#1834, #1866).
- `fix(ci): lint gh-aw generated workflows instead of skipping them` — generated workflow YAML is now included in the actionlint pass (#1854).

#### CLI
- `fix(cli): route watch/loop capability state through the effective state dir` — after `squad externalize`, all capability state reads/writes (decision hygiene, cleanup, retro, subsquad discovery, ralph-instructions check) now use `stateRoot` from `effectiveSquadDir().stateDir` instead of a bare `.squad/` join; closes #1490 (#1660).
- `fix(cli): verify process identity before killing tracked watch PIDs` — cross-checks the live process's OS start time against `spawnedAt` before killing, preventing collateral kills after crash + PID reuse (#1641, #1665).
- `fix(squad): make Scribe archival incapable of destroying state` — `squad nap` / `archiveDecisions` now refuses to run when the destination is untracked and git-ignored, verifies entry count before trimming the source, and uses fence-aware record-boundary scanning. SDK adds `archiveEntries()`, `resolveTrackedDestination()`, `prepareInboxBodyForMerge()`, `demoteHeadings()`; fixes #1774, #1783, #1760 (#1792).
- `fix(sdk): refuse consult when info/exclude resolves outside the project` — `setupConsultMode` now verifies `info/exclude` belongs to the repository rooted at `projectRoot`; prevents hiding `.squad/` across the main checkout and all sibling worktrees when called from a linked worktree (#1850).
- Watch's PID tracker cross-checks a live process's actual OS start time against `spawnedAt` before killing it, preventing collateral kills after a crash + PID reuse (#1665).

#### SDK
- `fix(sdk): wire FSStorageProvider rootDir in resolveSquadState` — `resolveSquadState()` now passes `rootDir: paths.teamDir` to `FSStorageProvider` so the path-traversal guard validates state writes; also fixes `resolveSquadPaths()` treating `config.teamRoot: "."` as remote mode, which pointed `teamDir` one level above `.squad/`; fixes #1555 (#1695).
- `fix(sdk): decode URL-encoded segments in Azure DevOps remote parsing` — `parseAzureDevOpsRemote()` decodes percent-encoded characters in org/project/repo segments for all three URL formats (`dev.azure.com`, SSH, legacy `visualstudio.com`), fixing `az` CLI calls for projects with spaces in their names; fixes #1526 (#1637).
- `fix(sdk): support command paths containing spaces in scheduler script tasks` — `LocalPollingProvider` now parses `task.ref` with quote awareness and longest-match path resolution, fixing scheduler tasks on the default Windows Node.js install path (`C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe`). Adds `TaskConfig.argv` as the unambiguous alternative. Spawn failures now surface a `spawnError` code instead of silently producing empty output; fixes #1794 (#1802).
- Insider tag promotion now split by package so SDK and CLI are promoted independently (#1710).

## [0.12.0] - 2026-08-12

### Added
- (cli) Ship GitHub Agentic Workflows (`gh-aw`): an executable SDLC lifecycle for Squad with `/squad research`, `/squad plan` (split into scope/impl/activate phases), `/squad cast`, and phased plan activation/acceptance, plus program-level planning (initiatives, epics, milestones), a planning policy schema, native dependency edges, and body-metadata sizing (#1649-#1658, #1680, #1685).
- (cli) Add standalone, npm-free distribution: Homebrew and winget packaging, a native `squad.exe`, and npm-free `squad_state` MCP spec generation for standalone bundles (#1593, #1610, #1611).

- (sdk+cli) Add category-based model cost policy with a live catalog/pricing refresh and `squad models refresh` (#1080, #1183, #1445).
- (cli) Support custom universes and descriptive default naming in casting, and add descriptive run-names to the Squad GitHub Actions workflow (#1635, #1643, #1646).
- (cli) Assign unique colors to squad member labels via deterministic hashing of slugified names (#1663).
- (cli) Add `squad update-check --json` for tooling/CI (#1440).

- (cli) Default new VS Code chat sessions to Squad on `squad init`.
- (sdk+cli) Add Layer A/B/C dispatch-enforcement governance: coordinator tool-profile restriction plus Scribe DispatchGuard audit infrastructure, with an identity lock and routing guard in `copilot-instructions.md` (#1537).
- Docs: add Azure hosting guides (Dockerfile contract, ACA, AKS), a production security-hardening guide (threat model, prompt-injection defense, credential hygiene), a production-operations runbook (observability, state-backend selection, troubleshooting), and a Microsoft Agent Framework integration guide (#1574, #1575, #1578, #1579).
- (cli) Add `gh aw init` tooling — skills, MCP config, and setup/maintenance workflows — for consuming gh-aw from a project (#1592).
- (sdk) Expose `memory.*` tools (classify, write, search, promote, delete, audit) through the `squad_state` MCP server so agents can manage tiered memory directly.
- (cli) Add a Squad implementation mode: `/squad implement` dispatches regular issues and ready epic tasks to an isolated implementation worker workflow, guarding dependency handling, duplicate-PR detection, concurrency, and PR file scope (#1682).
- (cli) Ship an Auto-Cast pivot for gh-aw: when a repo has no team yet, workflows write a pending-intent marker, dedupe in-flight Cast PRs, and resume the original request once casting completes, so a single issue can guide resumable work end-to-end (#1690).
- (sdk) Add `"max"` to `SquadReasoningEffort` and `VALID_REASONING_EFFORTS`, matching Copilot SDK 1.0.9's `ReasoningEffort = "max"` (#1693).

### Changed
- (cli) Harden the Squad coordinator workflow prompt for gh-aw reliability: hard completion gates, atomic task-call contracts, configurable model selection, forward-ported safe-output hardening, and prompt-size compression (135KB → under the 100KB gh-aw limit) (#1669, #1678, #1680, #1683, #1685).
- (cli) Make the coordinator canary check three-state and add a HEAD canary to catch false positives (#1461, #1517).
- (cli) Warn before launching 2+ parallel background agents in a shared worktree (#1484).
- (cli) CI: pin GitHub Actions references to immutable commit SHAs across shipped workflow templates, and fail CI when unreleased changesets accumulate (#1475, #1481).
- Docs: restructure navigation and do a voice pass across get-started, concepts, and issue-truth content; add the agentic-SDLC demo walkthrough (#1570-#1573).
- Refresh dependencies across the workspace, including TypeScript, Vitest 4, Ink 7, `@github/copilot-sdk`, `@github/copilot`, and OpenTelemetry, plus routine security/patch bumps.
- Bump `@hono/node-server` to 2.1.0 and the workspace's minor-patch dependency group (`@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`, `@typescript-eslint/parser`, `eslint`, `eslint-plugin-n`, `@types/node`, `@github/copilot-sdk`, `ws`) (#1692, #1694).

### Fixed
- (cli) Pin the CLI's `squad-sdk` dependency to the exact published version in `publish-cli` so installs can no longer resolve a stale SDK (#1638).
- (cli) `squad watch`'s self-pull capability no longer abandons stashed local changes when `git pull --ff-only` fails (#1640).
- (sdk) Normalize dotted `ToolRegistry` names at the Copilot external-tool boundary.
- (sdk) Add a recursive `deleteDir` and rename the `external` stub to `external-stub` (#1487).
- (cli) Fix `squad externalize`/`internalize` corrupting non-UTF-8 files under `.squad/` (#1492).
- (sdk+cli) Promote the insider dist-tag when `latest` is newer (#1495).
- (cli) Follow externalized state in `squad copilot` and `squad rc` (#1464).
- (cli) Quote `GITHUB_OUTPUT`/`GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` redirects (SC2086) and add an `actionlint` CI gate (#1557).
- (cli) Downgrade the `issues` permission to read in the gh-aw workflow, and fix the gh-aw guide link in the README.
- Docs: fix pre-existing broken links, correct platform-specific path examples, and add PATH-fix installation troubleshooting guidance (#1459).
- (cli) `ralph-triage` no longer hardcodes `api.github.com`; it resolves the GitHub API base from `GITHUB_API_URL`/`GITHUB_SERVER_URL` so Squad Heartbeat triage works on GitHub Enterprise runners (#1142).
- (cli) `squad export` now resolves externalized state: after `squad externalize`, export reads from the external state directory instead of the stale local `.squad/` copy (#1396).

### Security
- (cli) Exclude nested/alumni agent history paths from the unsafe-git scanner so DispatchGuard audits don't false-positive on archived agent state (#1559).

## [0.11.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added
- (cli) Add `squad preset install <source>` for installing shared presets from GitHub URLs or local paths (#1224).
- (cli) Add `squad registry add/list/remove` for discovery-only peer squads, plus the bundled cross-squad communication skill.

- (sdk+cli) Add Copilot App sub-session spawning for cast members and thread reasoning-effort settings through agent dispatch (#1385).
- (sdk+cli) Expose memory tools through the `squad_state` MCP server and improve Fact Checker auto-scaffolding/plumbing.

### Changed
- (sdk+cli) Slim the bundled `squad.agent.md` by extracting long guidance into satellite skills (#1311).
- (cli) Move bundled skills from `.copilot/skills/` to `.github/skills/` so they are visible to all Copilot surfaces.
- (cli) Rename user-facing ".NET Aspire" references to "Aspire" in CLI help and command output (#1239).
- (sdk+cli) Refresh the toolchain and integrations, including `@github/copilot-sdk` 1.0.4, TypeScript 6, Vitest 4, Ink 7, OpenTelemetry 2.x, and Node type updates.

### Fixed
- (cli) Pin CLI-to-SDK workspace resolution so local builds and runtime use the workspace SDK instead of a stale published package (#1406).
- (sdk+cli) Restore the green test suite by reconciling personal squad paths, stabilizing observer category handling, guarding storage case-insensitivity, and skipping environment-dependent tests when prerequisites are missing (#1416).
- (sdk+cli) Guard symlink-sensitive tests on Windows or restricted CI filesystems (#1418).
- (sdk+cli) Harden observer change resolution for directory events, symlinks, and filesystem scan errors.
- (sdk+cli) Fix state-backend handshake, SQUAD_HOME/SQUAD_PERSONAL_DIR resolution, preset apply wiring, routing example quote stripping, YAML escaping, and MCP config pollution regressions.
- (cli) Fix Windows command escaping, top-level help coverage for `externalize`/`internalize`, slash-command discovery, and upgrade/self-repair flows.
- (sdk) Export gitignore-state helpers, update OTel resource APIs for 2.x, and align the adapter client with `@github/copilot-sdk` 1.0.4.

## [0.10.0] — 2026-06-07

First stable release since v0.9.4 (April 25). Consumes 97 changesets (sdk: 50, cli: 71).

### Security
- (cli) iter-9: inject `--yolo --additional-mcp-config @.mcp.json` in all non-interactive copilot spawns; fix path regression from `.copilot/mcp-config.json` (iter-7) to `.mcp.json` (iter-8 canonical location); add fallback warning when `.mcp.json` is absent; add `--yolo` deduplication guard; document Copilot CLI 1.0.59+ folder-trust security gate

- (cli) Fix Windows spawn EINVAL in watch capabilities by adding `shell: true` to `execFile()` calls in monitor-teams, monitor-email, retro, and decision-hygiene capabilities. Add Copilot CLI preflight check to `squad doctor` and monitor capabilities so missing `gh copilot` extension is flagged early. Improve team hire confirmation UX to show member names inline with the prompt. (closes #920, closes #880, closes #1107)
- (sdk) Bump `@github/copilot-sdk` from `^0.1.32` to `^0.3.0` to fix ESM module resolution error (ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND for vscode-jsonrpc/node). Add explicit GitHub repo config support in `.squad/config.json` (`{ "github": { "owner": "...", "repo": "..." } }`) so platform adapter prefers user-specified repo over auto-detection from origin remote. (closes #1062, closes #905)

- (cli) fix(cli): revert detect-squad-dir to zero-dependency bootstrap
- (cli) fix: restore CI green on dev — 25 regression fixes + 6 test corrections
- (cli) Fix export/import producing blank decisions.md and team.md files. Export now includes these files in the manifest, and import restores their content.
- (cli) Fix runtime commands to correctly resolve externalized state paths
- (sdk+cli) Fix 5 bugs: dotted repo names, icon spacing, board owner, charter passing, missing playbooks
- (cli) fix: `/init` with no args now accepts follow-up message as cast prompt, and `createTeam` correctly creates `team.md`/`routing.md` in fresh projects
- (cli) fix(nap): account for separator newlines in decision archival budget
- (cli) fix(cli): wire --team-root / SQUAD_TEAM_ROOT into squad resolution for nap, status, and cost commands (#734)

- (sdk+cli) Fix state-backend and upgrade regressions (#1163, #1185, #1190, #1191, #1194)
- (cli) Fix `squad <command> --help` silently running the command instead of showing help (#1201)
- (cli) Extend SQUAD_TEAM_ROOT to all resolveSquad() call sites for subprocess compatibility
- (sdk+cli) Fix triage label slug derivation: use `slugify()` instead of `toLowerCase()` so multi-word agent names produce valid GitHub labels (e.g. "Steve Rogers" → `squad:steve-rogers` instead of `squad:steve rogers`).
- (cli) fix(watch): Windows shell:true, shared agent-spawn, round-level fetch (#920, #923)
- (sdk+cli) fix: use TEMPLATE_MANIFEST to drive skill installation instead of wholesale directory copy
- (sdk) Fix squad-commands skill routing and configuration for Copilot integration
- (sdk) State backend hardening: retry with exponential backoff for transient git errors, circuit-breaker to prevent cascading failures, read-only startup verification, and observable error surfacing replacing silent swallowing.
- (cli) fix(watch): 3 UX improvements — round timing output, --log-file tee flag, immediate startup feedback (#2141)
- (sdk+cli) Fix Windows Azure CLI execution and ADO state mapping in squad watch
- (sdk) fix(sdk): wire `squad_route` tool handler to actually create target sessions

### Changed
- **Communications:** `createCommunicationAdapter` is now async. Downstream consumers building custom adapters must `await` the factory call. Not flagged as breaking per pre-1.0 SemVer.
- (sdk) ADO configurable work item types, area paths, and iteration support (#240)
- (cli) Ship 8 built-in skills with squad init/upgrade (#788)
- (cli) Allow memory diagnostics log level to be configured from `.squad/config.json`.

- (sdk+cli) Squad coordinator now scans all 5 project skill directories: Copilot CLI's 3
- (sdk+cli) Generic, provider-agnostic scheduler for Squad (#296) — unified schedule.json manifest with LocalPolling and GitHubActions provider adapters, CLI commands (list, run, init, status), schema validation, and cron/interval trigger evaluation.
- (sdk+cli) Harden runtime state tools so write, append, and delete only mutate approved Squad runtime state paths, and refresh prompt templates to require state-tool persistence and literal datetime propagation.
- (cli) Widen changelog-gate coverage for template and scaffolding paths

## [0.8.24] - 2026-03-08

### Added — Azure DevOps Platform Adapter
- **PlatformAdapter interface** — unified API for GitHub, ADO, and Microsoft Planner
- **AzureDevOpsAdapter** — `az boards` CLI for work items, `az repos` for PRs
- **GitHubAdapter** — `gh` CLI wrapper implementing PlatformAdapter
- **PlannerAdapter** — Microsoft Graph API for hybrid work-item tracking
- **Cross-project ADO config** via `.squad/config.json` — work items can live in a different org/project than the repo

### Added — CommunicationAdapter
- **Pluggable agent-human messaging** — Scribe/Ralph can post updates through platform-appropriate channels
- **Four adapters:** FileLog (zero-config), GitHub Discussions, ADO Work Item Discussions, Teams Webhook (stub)
- **Factory auto-detection** — `createCommunicationAdapter(repoRoot)` selects the right adapter

### Added — SubSquads (Community-Voted Rename)
- Workstreams → SubSquads across CLI, types, and docs
- CLI: `squad subsquads` (with `workstreams` and `streams` as deprecated aliases)
- Old names preserved as `@deprecated` re-exports for backward compatibility

### Fixed — Security Hardening
- `execSync` → `execFileSync` (prevents shell injection)
- `escapeWiql()` helper (prevents WIQL injection in ADO queries)
- `curl --config stdin` (hides bearer tokens from process listing)
- Case-insensitive URL detection for ADO remotes
- Cross-platform draft filter (`findstr` → JMESPath)
- PR status mapping (`active` → `open` for `gh` CLI)
- `gh issue create` fix (parse URL from stdout, not `--json`)

### Fixed — ESM Runtime Patch + Secret Guardrails
- Runtime `Module._resolveFilename` intercept for Node 24+ ESM compatibility
- 5-layer secret defense architecture
- 59 TDD security hook tests
- `.squad/skills/secret-handling/SKILL.md` team reference

- 59 security tests
- 8 issues closed
- 3 new docs pages, 6+ broken links fixed

## [0.8.23] - 2026-03-12

### Fixed — Node 24+ ESM Import Crash
- **Node 24+ `squad init` crash fix (#XXX)** — v0.8.23 resolves `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND: Cannot find module 'vscode-jsonrpc/node'` crash that occurs on Node.js 24+ and GitHub Codespaces. Root cause: upstream ESM import issue in `@github/copilot-sdk`. Two-layer defense implemented:
  - **Lazy imports** — Commands `init`, `build`, `link`, `migrate` no longer eagerly load copilot-sdk at startup
  - **Postinstall patch** — Automatically fixes broken ESM import at install time
  - Side benefit: Faster CLI startup for non-session commands

### Added — Squad RC Documentation
- Comprehensive guide for `squad rc` (Remote Control) covering:
  - ACP (Azure Communication Platform) passthrough architecture
  - 7-layer security model for session isolation and encryption
  - Mobile keyboard shortcuts and accessibility features
  - Troubleshooting guide for common connection issues

### By the Numbers
- 2 issues closed
- 3 PRs merged

  - `defineCasting()` — Casting configuration (universe allowlists, overflow strategy)
  - `defineTelemetry()` — OpenTelemetry configuration
  - `defineSquad()` — Top-level composition builder
- **`squad build` command** — Compile TypeScript definitions to `.squad/` markdown
  - Generates `.squad/team.md`, `.squad/routing.md`, agent charters, ceremonies
  - Supports `--check` (validation), `--dry-run` (preview), `--watch` (file monitoring stub)
  - Protected files (decisions.md, history.md) never overwritten
- **SDK Mode Detection** — Coordinator prompt includes SDK-First mode awareness

  - README quick reference for SDK-First teams

### Added — Remote Squad Mode (ported from @spboyer's [bradygaster/squad#131](https://github.com/bradygaster/squad/pull/131))
- `resolveSquadPaths()` dual-root resolver — project-local vs team identity directories
- `squad doctor` command — 9-check setup validation with emoji output
- `squad link <path>` command — link a project to a remote team root
- `squad init --mode remote` — initialize with remote team root config
- `ensureSquadPathDual()` / `ensureSquadPathResolved()` — dual-root write guards

### Fixed — Critical Crash & Stability Issues
- **Installation crash fix (#247)** — `npx @bradygaster/squad-cli` was failing on fresh installs due to hard dependency on `@opentelemetry/api` that couldn't resolve in isolated npm environments. Created `otel-api.ts` resilient wrapper with full no-op fallbacks. Moved OTel to optional dependencies. Telemetry now gracefully degrades when absent.
- **CLI command wiring (#244)** — Commands `rc`, `copilot-bridge`, `init-remote`, `rc-tunnel` were implemented but never wired into CLI entry point. Now properly connected and discoverable.
- **Model config round-trip (#245)** — `AgentDefinition.model` now accepts `string | ModelPreference` for structured model configuration. Charter compiler updated to emit and parse the new format correctly.
- **ExperimentalWarning suppression** — Node's `ExperimentalWarning` for `node:sqlite` no longer leaks into terminal output. Suppressed via process.emit override in cli-entry.ts.
- **Blankspace fix (#239)** — Idle blank space below agent panel removed. Conditional height constraint only active during processing.
- **Windows race condition (EBUSY)** — `fs.rm` with retry logic and exponential backoff. Tests now pass reliably on Windows.
- **Test hardening** — Speed gate threshold adjustments for growing CLI codebase. 25 regression tests fixed (PR #221).
- **CI stabilization** — GitHub Actions pipeline fixed and green (PRs #232, #228).

### Changed — Distribution & Versioning
- **Distribution:** npm-only distribution channel. No more GitHub-native distribution (`npx github:bradygaster/squad`). Users now install via `npm install -g @bradygaster/squad-cli` or `npx @bradygaster/squad-cli` from npm registry.
- **Semantic Versioning fix (#692):** Version format changed from `X.Y.Z.N-preview` to `X.Y.Z-preview.N` to comply with semantic versioning spec (prerelease identifier after patch, build metadata after prerelease). Example: `0.8.6-preview.1` instead of `0.8.6.1-preview`.
- **Version transition:** Public repo final version was `0.8.5.1`. Private repo continues at `0.8.x` cadence (next publish after 0.8.17 is 0.8.18), following semver prerelease convention for development.

### Community
- Thanks to **Shayne Boyer** ([@spboyer](https://github.com/spboyer)) for the original remote mode design.
- PR #199 (migration command) received, reviewed, and feedback captured as issue #231 for future implementation.
- PR #243 (blankspace fix) — community contribution cherry-picked and credited.

### By the Numbers
- 26 issues closed
- 16 PRs merged
- 3,724 tests passing (3,740 total, 13 known Windows timeout flakes, 0 logic failures)
- 8 builder functions shipped
- 4 CLI commands wired
- 1 critical crash fix (OTel dependency)
- 25 regression tests fixed

## [Unreleased]

## [0.8.20] - 2025-01-08

### Fixed
- **Template path fix (#190):** Corrected all references from `.squad-templates/` to `.squad/templates/` to align with the project's directory structure. This ensures the CLI correctly resolves team member charters and other template resources.
- **Init test templates:** Updated initialization tests to reference the corrected `.squad/templates/` directory path.

## [0.8.18-preview] - TBD

### Added — Remote Squad Mode (ported from @spboyer's [bradygaster/squad#131](https://github.com/bradygaster/squad/pull/131))
- `resolveSquadPaths()` dual-root resolver — project-local vs team identity directories (#311)
- `squad doctor` command — 9-check setup validation with emoji output (#312)
- `squad link <path>` command — link a project to a remote team root (#313)
- `squad init --mode remote` — initialize with remote team root config (#313)
- `ensureSquadPathDual()` / `ensureSquadPathResolved()` — dual-root write guards (#314)

### Changed — npm Distribution & Monorepo Structure
- **Distribution:** Migrated from GitHub-native (`npx github:bradygaster/squad`) to npm packages (`npm install -g @bradygaster/squad-cli` / `npx @bradygaster/squad-cli`)
- **Packages:** Independent versioning via @changesets/cli — `@bradygaster/squad-sdk` and `@bradygaster/squad-cli` evolve on separate cadences
- **Structure:** Monorepo layout with workspace packages (SDK + CLI)
- **Directory:** `.squad/` directory structure (migration from `.ai-team/`)
- **Semantic Versioning:** All versions now comply with semver spec (prerelease format `X.Y.Z-preview.N`)

### Fixed
- CLI entry point moved from `dist/index.js` to `dist/cli-entry.js`. If you reference the binary directly, update your path. `npx` and `npm` bin resolution is unchanged. (#187)
- CRLF normalization: All parsers now normalize line endings before parsing. Windows users with `core.autocrlf=true` no longer get `\r`-tainted values. (#220, #221)
- `process.exit()` removed from library-consumable functions. VS Code extensions can now safely import CLI functions without risking extension host termination. (#189)
- Removed `.squad` branch protection guard (`squad-main-guard.yml`) — no longer needed with npm workspace `files` field exclusions

### Internal
- New utility: `normalizeEol()` in `src/utils/normalize-eol.ts`
- New entry point: `src/cli-entry.ts` (CLI bootstrap separated from library exports)
- Migrated to npm workspace publishing (`@bradygaster/squad-sdk`, `@bradygaster/squad-cli`)
- Changesets infrastructure for independent package versioning
