# Squad Bootstrap Component — installs and initializes Squad
# (https://github.com/bradygaster/squad) in the activation job, then hands off
# the generated team state to the agent job.
#
# This is the DISTRIBUTION version of the bootstrap, living under workflows/shared/
# so users can pull it via:

# Design credit: adapted from Peli de Halleux's proven gh-aw integration in
# github/gh-aw. Original:
#   https://github.com/github/gh-aw/blob/main/.github/workflows/shared/squad.md
#
# The Squad CLI is never installed or executed in the agent job — only the files it
# produces (`.squad/` team state and `.github/agents/squad.agent.md`) are restored
# there. The activation job downloads a self-contained GitHub Release bundle, runs
# initialization, and hands the resulting state to the network-constrained agent job.
#
# Usage (as an import in your gh-aw workflow):
#   imports:
#     - shared/squad.md
#
# Usage (remote import, pinned to a ref):
#   imports:
#     - bradygaster/squad/workflows/shared/squad.md@latest
#   (Pin to a SHA for reproducible builds:
#     - bradygaster/squad/workflows/shared/squad.md@<40-char-commit-sha>)
#
# How the coordinator reaches the agent: gh-aw natively restores files under
# `.github/agents/*.agent.md` as inline sub-agents. The `squad.agent.md` that
# `squad init` writes is picked up by that mechanism. Additionally, `engine.agent`
# is set to `squad`, so the compiler emits `--agent squad` on the Copilot invocation.
#
# `ambient-folders` adds committed `.squad/` state to gh-aw's activation checkout
# so the roster guard can preserve an existing cast. The explicit artifact below
# remains the fail-fast handoff for the standalone distribution.
#
# Optional custom credentials for `squad init`:
#   vars.SQUAD_GITHUB_APP_ID / secrets.SQUAD_GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY / vars.SQUAD_GITHUB_APP_OWNER
#     — mints a GitHub App installation token
#   secrets.SQUAD_GITHUB_TOKEN
#     — fallback if the App ID is not set
# Auth precedence: GitHub App installation token > SQUAD_GITHUB_TOKEN > github.token
#
# Optional custom Squad CLI version:
#   vars.SQUAD_CLI_VERSION
# Default is v0.13.1.
#   This is a GitHub Release tag whose standalone assets are installed without npm.
#   Values without a leading `v` are normalized for compatibility with older configs.
#
# Optional model override:
#   vars.SQUAD_MODEL
#   Set to a model name or alias (e.g., 'agent', 'opus', 'gpt-5.6-sol',
#   'claude-opus-4.6'). Omit or set to 'auto' for engine default. The gh-aw
#   proxy resolves aliases based on model availability, so if the chosen model
#   is unavailable the proxy walks a fallback chain automatically.
#
# State backend is pinned to `local`: the compiled agent invocation passes
# `--disable-builtin-mcps`, so Squad's `state-mcp` bridge does not load. A non-local
# backend would fail silently. If a committed .squad/team.md with roster entries
# exists (e.g. from a previous /squad cast), init is skipped to preserve it.

## Squad Bootstrap Component

This shared component handles the entire Squad install/init lifecycle outside the
agent sandbox:

1. **`jobs.activation.steps`** — the repository is already checked out by the
   activation job. This step optionally mints a GitHub App installation token (or
   uses a supplied PAT), downloads the selected standalone GitHub Release bundle,
   checks whether `.squad/team.md` already exists with roster entries (preserving
   any previously committed cast), and only runs `squad init` if no usable team
   is found. It then runs `squad health --json` when the installed release
   supports it and uploads the resulting `.squad/` team state plus
   `.github/agents/squad.agent.md` only when readiness checks pass — all inside
   the activation job without contacting an npm registry.

2. **`steps:`** (agent job) — downloads the `squad-state` artifact and restores it
   into the workspace. The Squad CLI is never installed here; only the files it
   produced are needed.

-->

## Working with Squad

Squad's team state (`.squad/`) and its Copilot custom agent
(`.github/agents/squad.agent.md`) were initialized during activation and restored
into this checkout before you started — do **not** install Squad or run `squad init`
yourself.

- Verify `.squad/team.md` exists before delegating work to the team. If it is
  missing, the activation-job bootstrap step failed — call `noop` and explain
  why instead of proceeding.
- Coordinate work through the Squad team already defined in `.squad/` rather
  than proposing a brand-new team from scratch.
- This run uses the `local` state backend, and the Squad `state-mcp` bridge is
  **not** available (the agent runs with `--disable-builtin-mcps`). Treat `.squad/`
  as plain files on disk.
- State does **not** carry over between runs unless a committed `.squad/team.md`
  with roster entries exists — in that case, the bootstrap preserves it. The
  casting registry, session logs, and any output produced live only for this run.
