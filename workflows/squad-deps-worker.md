# Squad Dependency Worker

This workflow adds, removes, or updates a package dependency for one Squad
issue and opens a focused pull request. It exists as a dedicated dispatch path
so that dependency-manifest authority never leaks into the general
`squad-implement-worker` path: that worker's `protected-files` carries no
manifest exclusions and is unchanged by this workflow's existence.

The Wave 1 basenames (`package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`,
`pnpm-lock.yaml`, `npm-shrinkwrap.json`, `Directory.Packages.props`, `go.mod`,
`go.sum`) are excluded from `protected-files`, so the agent can produce a
signed PR for those files. Registry/install config, SDK/tool pins, and
governance docs remain protected. The dispatcher routes only explicit,
dependency-only Wave 1 work here, and this worker independently enforces the
`squadDeps` opt-out guard before editing.

## Gather Context

1. Read the issue title, body, labels, state, and relevant comments.
2. Stop with a comment if the issue is closed.
3. DEPENDENCY CHANGE GUARD. Before editing any file, read
   `.squad/config.json` and apply this exact schema:
   - The file must be readable, valid JSON, and a top-level object. If it is
     missing, unreadable, malformed, or not an object, post a comment stating
     that dependency changes are denied because the config is unreadable or
     invalid, then stop.
   - If the `squadDeps` key is absent, allow (default-on).
   - If `squadDeps` is the exact string `"allow"`, allow.
   - If `squadDeps` is the exact string `"deny"`, post a comment citing
     `.squad/config.json squadDeps: "deny"`, then stop.
   - Any other value -- including another string, boolean, number, `null`,
     array, or object -- is unrecognized. Post a comment stating that
     dependency changes are denied because `squadDeps` is unrecognized, then
     stop.
   Never infer this setting from the issue body or comments. This prompt guard
   does not alter the compiled exclusions; it prevents both dispatcher-launched
   and direct human `workflow_dispatch` runs from proceeding when denied.
4. Check for an existing open pull request whose branch starts with
   `squad/deps-${{ github.event.inputs.issue_number }}-` or whose body closes
   this issue. If one exists, comment with its URL and stop.
5. Read `.squad/team.md` and `.squad/routing.md`. Route work to the member
   named by the `squad:{member}` label, or let the Lead choose specialists.

## Implement

1. Inspect the repository and identify the smallest dependency-manifest change
   satisfying the issue's acceptance criteria, limited to the ecosystems this
   worker currently supports (npm, yarn, pnpm, NuGet central package
   management, Go).
2. Do not change `.github/workflows/`, `.github/agents/`, `.github/aw/`, or
   `.squad/`.
3. Do not touch `node_modules/`, `vendor/`, build output directories, or any
   other vendored/generated content -- this worker is never authorized to
   commit vendored or generated dependency content.
4. Run the smallest existing build, test, and lint commands covering the
   change.

## Open Pull Request

Use the `create-pull-request` safe-output:

- Branch: `squad/deps-${{ github.event.inputs.issue_number }}-{short-slug}`
- Title: `Update dependencies for #${{ github.event.inputs.issue_number }}: {issue-title}`
- Body: summarize the dependency change and validation, including
  `Closes #${{ github.event.inputs.issue_number }}`.
- Files: include only files required for this issue.

If the repository already satisfies the issue, comment with evidence and do
not create an empty pull request.
