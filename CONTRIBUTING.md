# Contributing to Squad

Welcome to Squad development. This guide explains how to build, test, and contribute.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** ≥20.0.0
- **npm** ≥10.0.0 (for workspace support)
- **Git** with SSH agent (for package resolution)
- **gh CLI** (for GitHub integration testing)

## Community Guidelines & Spam Protection

Our repository uses automated spam detection to maintain a safe, productive community. Here's what you need to know:

### Spam Detection Guidelines
- **Comment screening** — Malicious links (shortened URLs, file-sharing services) and mass-mentions are monitored
- **Issue evaluation** — New issues are reviewed for spam patterns; suspected spam may be auto-closed
- **Auto-lock stale content** — Issues and PRs inactive for 30+ days are locked to prevent spam on old threads

### What Gets Flagged
- Shortened URLs (bit.ly, tinyurl, t.co, goo.gl, rb.gy)
- File-sharing links (Dropbox, Google Drive, Mega, MediaFire)
- Crypto/investment scams ("free bitcoin", "guaranteed profit", etc.)
- Adult content patterns
- Mass-mentions (4+ @-mentions in one comment)
- New accounts (< 30 days old) with 0 repos, 0 followers + suspicious content

### If Your Content Is Flagged
- **Comment not posted** — If your comment contains flagged patterns, it may be held for review
- **Issue closed as spam** (clear violation) — Likely closed with explanation; contact maintainers if you believe this is a mistake
- **Issue labeled "suspicious"** — Flagged for maintainer review but remains open
- **Issue locked** — If inactive for 30+ days, locked to prevent spam replies

If your legitimate issue/comment is caught by spam detection, please contact a maintainer. We're here to help.

## Monorepo Structure

Squad is an npm workspace monorepo with two packages:

```
squad/
├── packages/squad-cli/       # CLI tool (@bradygaster/squad-cli)
├── packages/squad-sdk/       # Runtime SDK (@bradygaster/squad-sdk)
├── src/                      # Legacy CLI code (migrating to packages/)
├── dist/                     # Compiled output
├── .squad/                   # Team state and agent history
├── docs/                     # Documentation and proposals
└── test-fixtures/            # Test data
```

### Package Independence

- **squad-sdk**: Core runtime, agent orchestration, tool registry. No CLI dependencies.
- **squad-cli**: Command-line interface. Depends on squad-sdk.

Each package has independent versioning via changesets. A change to squad-sdk may bump only squad-sdk; a change to CLI bumps only squad-cli.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone and Install

**Step 1: Fork the repo on GitHub**

Go to https://github.com/bradygaster/squad and click "Fork" to create your own copy.

**Step 2: Clone your fork**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:{yourusername}/squad.git
cd squad
```

**Step 3: Add upstream remote**

```bash
git remote add upstream git@github.com:bradygaster/squad.git
```

**Step 4: Fetch the dev branch**

```bash
git fetch upstream dev
```

**Step 5: Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

npm workspaces automatically links local packages. `@bradygaster/squad-cli` can import from `@bradygaster/squad-sdk` without publishing.

### 2. Build

```bash
# Compile TypeScript to dist/
npm run build

# Build + bundle CLI (includes esbuild)
npm run build:cli

# Watch mode (auto-recompile on changes)
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test

```bash
# Run all tests (Vitest)
npm test

# Watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

### 4. Lint

```bash
# Type check only (no emit)
npm run lint
```

### 5. Keeping Your Fork in Sync

Before opening or updating a PR, rebase your branch on the latest upstream dev:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/dev
git push origin your-branch --force-with-lease
```

Always rebase before opening or updating a PR to ensure your changes are based on the latest integration branch.

## Development Workflow

### Creating a Feature Branch

Follow the branch naming convention from `.squad/decisions.md`:

```bash
# For user-facing work, use user_name/issue-number-slug format
git checkout -b bradygaster/217-readme-help-update
# or
git checkout -b keaton/210-resolution-api

# For team-internal work, use agent_name/issue-number-slug
git checkout -b mcmanus/documentation
git checkout -b edie/refactor-router
```

### Before Committing

1. **Compile:** `npm run build` (or `npm run dev` watch mode)
2. **Test:** `npm test`
3. **Type check:** `npm run lint`

All checks must pass before commit.

### Commit Message Format

Keep messages clear and concise. Reference the issue number:

```
Brief description of change

Longer explanation if needed. Reference #210, #217, etc.

Co-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>
```

The Co-authored-by trailer is **required** for all commits (added by Copilot CLI).

### Pull Request Process

1. Add a changeset: `npx changeset add` (required before PR — see Changesets section)
2. Push your branch: `git push origin {yourusername}/217-readme-help-update`
3. Create a PR **as a draft**: `gh pr create --draft --base dev --repo bradygaster/squad --head {yourusername}:your-branch`
4. Link the issue: Add `Closes #217` to PR description
5. Work on your changes until CI passes and you're satisfied
6. **Mark as "Ready for review"** — this is the handoff signal to the core team (see below)

### Handoff: Contributor → Core Team

External contributors don't have write access, so the review-to-merge flow has a handoff point. Here's exactly what happens:

**Your side (contributor):**

1. ✅ All required CI checks are green (build, test, lint; the changeset/CHANGELOG gate applies when `packages/squad-(sdk|cli)/src/` **or** governed template/scaffolding paths change — `packages/squad-(sdk|cli)/templates/`, `.squad-templates/`, top-level `templates/`, and `.squad/agents/*/charter.md`)
2. ✅ PR is no longer a draft — mark as **"Ready for review"**
3. ✅ Copilot reviewer bot posts its review automatically
4. ✅ Review Copilot's suggestions and manually apply any you agree with in your fork
5. ✅ Push updates to your branch to address Copilot's feedback
6. ✅ If Copilot flags issues you can't resolve, note them in a PR comment

> **Note:** Copilot review suggestions appear as comments, but the "Commit suggestion" and "Fix with Copilot" buttons require repo write access and won't work for external contributors. Review the suggestions, apply them manually in your fork, and push your changes.

**Core team side (after you undraft):**

1. Look for CI-green, undrafted PRs from contributors
2. Address any remaining Copilot review issues (using "Fix with Copilot" or manual fixes)
3. Human review, resolve threads, and merge

**TL;DR:** Your job is done when the PR is undrafted, CI is green, and you've responded to Copilot suggestions. The core team takes it from there.

### PR Readiness Checklist

An automated readiness check runs on every PR and posts a checklist comment. Address all items before requesting review:

| Check | What it means |
|-------|---------------|
| **Single commit** | Squash your commits into one clean commit, or the repo will squash on merge |
| **Not in draft** | Mark your PR as "Ready for review" when it's done |
| **Branch up to date** | Rebase on latest `dev` (`git fetch upstream && git rebase upstream/dev`) |
| **Copilot review** | Wait for the Copilot reviewer bot to post its review |
| **Changeset present** | Run `npx changeset add` if you changed `packages/squad-(sdk|cli)/src/` or governed template/scaffolding paths (`packages/squad-(sdk|cli)/templates/`, `.squad-templates/`, top-level `templates/`, `.squad/agents/*/charter.md`) |
| **No merge conflicts** | Resolve any conflicts with the target branch |
| **CI passing** | All CI checks (build, test, lint) must be green |

The readiness check is **informational** — it helps you self-serve before a human reviewer looks at your PR. It automatically re-runs after Squad CI completes, so the checklist stays up to date without manual intervention. See `.github/PR_REQUIREMENTS.md` for the full requirements spec.

## Code Style & Conventions

Squad follows strict TypeScript conventions:

- **Type Safety:** `strict: true`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess: true`
- **No `@ts-ignore`** — if a type error exists, fix the code
- **ESM-only** — no CommonJS, no dual-package
- **Async/await** — use async iterators for streaming
- **Error handling:** Structured errors with `fatal()`, `error()`, `warn()`, `info()`
- **No hype in docs** — factual, substantiated claims only (tone ceiling)

## Scoped Changes & Diff Hygiene

Keep every change as small and focused as the task requires. Incidental formatting changes make a small edit look like a whole-file rewrite — every line shows as a delta, which makes review hard and can hide the real change.

- **Keep changes scoped:** only touch the lines relevant to your change.
- **Don't reformat unrelated content:** do not re-indent, reorder, or refactor code or markdown that is unrelated to your change.
- **Preserve existing line endings:** if a file is committed with CRLF, keep CRLF. On Windows, be aware that `core.autocrlf=true` can silently rewrite a file's line endings on commit — stage such files with `core.autocrlf=false`, or add a `.gitattributes` rule pinning the file's `eol`.
- **Separate genuine reformats:** if a file genuinely needs reformatting, do it in a dedicated PR so it can be reviewed independently of functional changes.
- **Sanity-check the diff before pushing:** run `git diff --stat` / `git diff --numstat`. If a small change shows a whole-file delta, investigate (usually whitespace or line endings) before committing.

### Repairing a working tree that predates a `.gitattributes` rule

`.gitattributes` governs **checkout**, not files already on disk. Git only rewrites a working file when a pull also changes that file's *index* content — so adding a rule like `*.mjs text eol=lf` leaves every already-LF-in-index path **still CRLF on disk** in checkouts that already exist. Pulling the fix does not repair your tree (#1793).

This does not present as an error. A CRLF shebang survives Vite's shebang stripping as a bare `#`, the module fails to parse, and every vitest suite importing it reports **`no tests`** — a zero that reads as green (#1788).

If `squad doctor` reports `working tree line endings — N ... still have CRLF on disk`, run:

```bash
npm run fix:crlf
```

Then confirm — `squad doctor` re-runs the same check the repair is scoped to:

```bash
squad doctor
```

To inspect the raw state, list every tracked path and its line endings:

```bash
git ls-files --eol
```

Every entry whose `attr` includes `eol=lf` should read `w/lf`. Don't scope that to `"*.mjs"` — `.mjs` is simply where the symptom is loudest, but the pin (and the doctor check) covers every path `.gitattributes` pins, so an `*.mjs` filter can report all-clear while a pinned file elsewhere is still CRLF.

The repair rewrites the affected files from the index with `git checkout-index -f`. It is safe: it only touches paths git reports as having **no content difference** from the index, and it skips (never overwrites) any file with real uncommitted edits. `git checkout -- <path>` is *not* a substitute — in this state the file is content-clean, so git has nothing to restore and the command can silently no-op.

Do **not** fix this with `git add --renormalize .`. That rewrites the index — the opposite side of the defect — and in this repo it would sweep nearly every CRLF-storing `.ts` blob into a single line-ending churn commit. `.gitattributes` documents that exclusion deliberately. This is a local repair that should produce no commit at all.

## Documentation

- **README.md** — User-facing guide, quick start, architecture overview
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** — This file
- **docs/proposals/** — Design docs for significant changes (required before code)
- **.squad/agents/[name]/history.md** — Agent learnings and project context

All docs in v1 are **internal only**. No public docs site until v2.

## Local Development Versioning

When developing Squad locally, set the package version to `{next-version}-preview` (e.g. `0.8.6-preview`) or a numbered iteration like `0.8.6-preview.N`. The `insider` dist-tag uses `X.Y.Z-insider.N` versions. All three patterns are accepted by the CI Prerelease Version Guard.

This convention makes `squad version` show the preview tag locally, clearly indicating you're running unreleased source code, not the published npm package. The release agent will bump this to the final version at publish time, then immediately back to the next preview version for continued development.

### Making the `squad` Command Use Your Local Build

To make the `squad` CLI command globally available and pointing to your local development build:

```bash
npm run build -w packages/squad-sdk && npm run build -w packages/squad-cli
npm link -w packages/squad-cli
```

After this, `squad version` will show `0.8.6-preview` (or the current preview version). When you make code changes and rebuild, the `squad` command automatically picks up the changes—no need to reinstall. To verify your local build is active, the version output should include the `-preview` tag.

To revert back to the globally installed npm package version, run:

```bash
npm unlink -w packages/squad-cli
```

## Changesets: Independent Versioning

Squad uses [@changesets/cli](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for independent package versioning.

**When your PR changes SDK or CLI source files** (`packages/squad-sdk/src/` or `packages/squad-cli/src/`) **or governed template/scaffolding paths** (`packages/squad-(sdk|cli)/templates/`, `.squad-templates/`, top-level `templates/`, or `.squad/agents/*/charter.md`), add a changeset file instead of editing `CHANGELOG.md` directly. Changesets prevent merge conflicts when multiple PRs are open simultaneously and are the preferred workflow.

### Adding a Changeset

**Option A — Interactive (recommended):**

```bash
npx changeset add
```

This prompts:
1. Which packages changed? (squad-sdk, squad-cli, both)
2. What type? (patch, minor, major)
3. Brief summary of changes

Creates a file in `.changeset/` that's merged with your PR.

**Option B — Manual:**

Create a file at `.changeset/your-change-name.md` with frontmatter specifying the package and bump type, followed by a description:

```markdown
---
'@bradygaster/squad-cli': patch
---

Fix help text rendering for the status command
```

### Changeset Format

The frontmatter lists each affected package and its semver bump type. The body is a human-readable description that will appear in the generated CHANGELOG:

```markdown
---
"@bradygaster/squad-sdk": minor
"@bradygaster/squad-cli": patch
---

Add streaming support to agent orchestration. Update CLI to display stream progress.
```

### CI Changelog Gate

The `changelog-gate` CI check enforces that PRs touching SDK/CLI source files — or governed template/scaffolding paths (`packages/squad-(sdk|cli)/templates/`, `.squad-templates/`, top-level `templates/`, `.squad/agents/*/charter.md`) — include either:
- A `.changeset/*.md` file (preferred), **or**
- A direct `CHANGELOG.md` edit (backward-compatible)

If neither is present, the check fails. You can bypass it with the `skip-changelog` label.

### Release Workflow

The team runs changesets on the `dev` branch (via GitHub Actions):

```bash
npx changeset publish
```

This:
1. Bumps versions in `package.json`
2. Generates `CHANGELOG.md` entries
3. Publishes to npm
4. Creates GitHub releases

You don't need to manually version — changesets handle it.

CI watches for drift: `scripts/check-changeset-drift.mjs` warns on PRs and fails on `dev` pushes when more than 25 fragments are pending or the oldest is over 30 days old — a signal that `changeset version` needs to run.

## Branch Strategy

- **main** — Stable, published releases. All merges include changesets.
- **preview** — Staging branch for release candidates (promote: dev → preview → main).
- **bradygaster/dev** — Integration branch. **All PRs from forks must target this branch**, not `main`.
- **user/issue-slug** — Feature branches from users or agents.

> **Note:** The `insider` npm tag (`@bradygaster/squad-cli@insider`) publishes from `dev` via manual workflow dispatch. There is no separate insider branch.

## Continuous Integration

GitHub Actions runs on every push:

1. **Build:** `npm run build` and `npm run build:cli`
2. **Test:** `npm test`
3. **Lint:** `npm run lint`
4. **Changeset status:** `npm run changeset:check` (ensures PRs include a changeset)
5. **Diff Size Guard:** Warns when a single-commit PR touches 30+ files (likely branch contamination from staging all files at once on a stale branch). Always use explicit `git add <file>` instead.

All checks must pass before merge.

## Testing Template Changes (End-to-End)

Changes to coordinator and agent templates (`.squad-templates/squad.agent.md`, `scribe-charter.md`, etc.) can't be validated by unit tests alone — they're prompts interpreted by an LLM at runtime. For these changes, run real squad sessions against your locally-built CLI.

### Quick version

```bash
# 1. Build and link your branch
npm run build && cd packages/squad-cli && npm link && cd ../..

# 2. Create a disposable test repo
mkdir /tmp/sq-test && cd /tmp/sq-test
git init && echo "# Test" > README.md && git add -A && git commit -m "init"

# 3. Init a squad with your modified templates
squad init

# 4. Run a session and verify behavior
copilot -p "Picard, decide on a testing framework." 2>&1 | tee session.log
```

### Full guide

See `.squad-templates/skills/e2e-template-testing/SKILL.md` for the complete workflow: test matrix, evidence collection, verdict format, and anti-patterns.

### When is this needed?

- Any change to `.squad-templates/*.md` files
- Changes to init scaffolding that writes templates to target repos
- Changes to conditional template blocks (e.g. state-backend-aware prompts)

Unit tests (`npm test`) still run for logic changes — E2E template testing is an **additional** step, not a replacement.

## Common Tasks

### Add a CLI Command

1. Create the command file in `src/cli/commands/[name].js`
2. Add the route in `src/index.ts` (the `main()` function)
3. Update help text in the `--help` handler
4. Add tests in `test/cli/commands/[name].test.ts`
5. Document in README.md

### Add an SDK Export

1. Implement the feature in `src/[module]/`
2. Export from `src/index.ts`
3. Add tests
4. Document in README.md SDK section

### Migrate Legacy Code

The `src/` directory contains legacy code migrating to `packages/squad-cli/` and `packages/squad-sdk/`. When moving code:

1. Create the new file in the target package
2. Update imports in both locations
3. Ensure tests follow the file
4. Delete the old `src/` file once all references are updated
5. Document the migration in `.squad/agents/[name]/history.md`

## Key Files

- **src/index.ts** — CLI entry point and routing
- **src/resolution.ts** — Squad path resolution (repo vs. global)
- **.squad/decisions.md** — Team decisions and conventions
- **.squad/agents/[name]/charter.md** — Agent identity and expertise
- **package.json** — Workspace and script definitions
