# `.squad/e2e/` — End-to-End Test Procedures

**Owner:** Sims (E2E Test Engineer)
**Purpose:** Written, committed, re-runnable procedures for verifying the gh-aw / Squad integration against **existing** repositories. Fixture-side and new-repo/activation procedures are Booster's beat, not here.

## Where E2 and E3 are — and why they aren't here

The E-series numbering is **chronological in the operator's head, not a coverage plan**. That produced a folder that reads as though E2 and E3 were promised and never delivered. They were not promised. What actually happened:

- **E2 (Rule D / epic closure).** E1's evidence table left Rule D as `NOT VERIFIED` because the `detection` job hung on `Install ripgrep` before closure could be observed. A note in E1 called this *"a future E2 experiment"*, which some readers reasonably interpreted as a scenario slot. In practice, Rule D shares E1's trigger — the same merge-continuation relay closing the same last leaf — so a separate E2 would either duplicate E1's setup or fabricate the closure state. **E2 was folded back into E1 as a formal gate (see the `Rule D — the gate and its escape hatch` section of `E1-merge-continuation-relay.md`).** There is no E2 procedure and there will not be one unless Rule D develops a trigger of its own.

- **E3 (long-path rehearsal).** E3 was a live rehearsal of the full 8-run `research → triage → plan program → plan implementation → plan validate → plan accept scope → plan accept implementation → plan activate` walk against the `aspiregregator-squad-e2e` fixture on 2026-08-21. It surfaced #1784 (the token-leak defect that became E4). **The rehearsal's evidence never landed in this folder** — it lived on the operator's disk and became the input for E4 rather than a committed procedure of its own. E3 references you see in `E4-agent-binding-verification.md` (e.g., *"E3 produced `lead, lead, devrel`"*) are citations to that rehearsal record, not to a file that exists here.

- **E5 and beyond.** No procedures are currently under authorship. The `#1787` sibling-epic refill scenario is documented as a `Follow-on` inside `E4-agent-binding-verification.md` rather than as a standalone `E5-…` file, because it is not unattended-safe and cannot share E4's execution budget. If it graduates to a first-class E-scenario in the future, it should get its own numbered file at that time.

## Rules of thumb for future E-scenarios

- **A procedure without a committed file has no procedure.** Rehearsal notes on someone's disk are not evidence. If it matters enough to run, it matters enough to commit.
- **Number by chronological authorship, not by pretending the numbering is a plan.** Gaps in the number sequence are honest information, not a claim of missing work — this file exists so future readers stop asking "where's E2?"
- **The status column in this file is the source of truth for what has been executed and when.** Do not let a scenario document drift from its own `Status:` header.
- **`windows-test-baseline.md` is intentionally here** despite not being an E-scenario. It sits with the E-scenarios because operators running E-scenarios need it. Its own header calls out that it is a human-interpretation runbook, not a procedure — do not let its file location seed the "so where are E2/E3/E5+?" question.

## Runbook conventions — writing a gate that cannot pass while broken

E-scenario commands are executed by a human operator, not by CI, so a command that **cannot run at all** can sit in a runbook indefinitely. That is a documentation bug right up until it meets a gate whose pass condition is universally quantified — *"every `squad:{x}` on a newly created issue must be a roster Name"*. Such a condition is **vacuously true over the empty set**. A broken command that returns nothing does not merely fail to inform the verdict; it writes the *passing* answer into it.

E4 Phase 3b did exactly this (#1822). Two conventions follow, and neither is optional:

- **A universally-quantified gate must assert its input set is non-empty before evaluating.** Zero rows is a distinct outcome from "all rows satisfied the predicate" and must be scored separately — as `INCONCLUSIVE`, never as a verdict value. Phase 3a had this instruction and was safe; 3b did not and was not.
- **Never let an infrastructure failure reach a `# dispositive` field.** When a command's exit code is non-zero, or its cutoff variable is unset, report `INCONCLUSIVE` and stop. Recording the "clean" value because the query came back empty inverts the meaning of the gate.

Two mechanizable halves of this are enforced by `test/e2e-runbook-hygiene.test.ts`, which lints every fenced command in this folder on each build:

- **`gh` is never passed `--arg`.** It is a `jq` flag; `gh` has none. `--jq` consumes it as its expression and the rest degrade into stray positionals, so `gh` exits 1 with empty stdout rather than an obvious parse error. Interpolate the value in the host shell and pass one complete `--jq` expression.
- **Every suppressed stderr is paired with an exit-code check.** Suppression is fine for transcript readability, but unpaired it converts a hard failure into an empty result that reads as a pass.

The linter reads only fenced code blocks and skips comments, so a runbook may — and should — describe these hazards in prose without tripping its own gate.

## Fixture

All E-scenarios currently target `octodemo/aspiregregator-squad-e2e` (internal). Fixture-refresh procedure is embedded in E4's Phase 0. Do not point an E-scenario at a different fixture without first documenting why the existing fixture cannot express the scenario — a bent fixture proves less than an honest gap.

**Fixture move, 2026-08-24 — the documented "why".** The previous fixture, `bradygaster/aspiregregator-squad-e2e`, was **deleted** along with every other test repo. The move was therefore forced, not preferential: the old fixture cannot express any scenario because it no longer exists. Two consequences that are easy to get wrong:

- **The repo name was deliberately reused**, so a match on the bare name `aspiregregator-squad-e2e` no longer identifies the fixture uniquely. Evidence checks must match **owner and name** (E1's `blocked_by_job_url` cross-check was tightened for exactly this).
- **The new fixture is a bare application repo.** It is a copy of `bradygaster/Aspiregregator` — the pristine, read-only origin, which must be copied and never run against or modified — and it has **no `.squad/` directory**, hence no roster, until Squad is activated on it. Every issue number, run ID, and roster name recorded in E1/E4 belongs to the retired fixture and must be **re-derived**, not find-and-replaced (see E4 Phase 0-pre).

Runs bill to `octodemo` because the `bradygaster` org was near its Actions-minute limit.
