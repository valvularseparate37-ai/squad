# E1 — Merge-Continuation Relay: Evidence Record

**Date:** 2026-08-21  
**Fixture repo (this run):** `bradygaster/aspiregregator-squad-e2e` — ⚠️ **retired.** Deleted 2026-08-24 along with every other test repo. The name is preserved here deliberately: this is an *evidence record*, and it must keep stating which repo actually produced the readings below. Re-runs target a different repo — see `$FIXTURE` in *PASS observation* below.  
**Recorded by:** FIDO (Quality Owner)

## Summary

The merge-continuation relay — which had **never once succeeded** before tonight — worked end to end on 2026-08-21.

**E1 verdict: PASS (with one gate NOT VERIFIED)** — 7 of 8 tested items passed. The eighth — **Rule D / epic closure** — was **NOT VERIFIED** due to a `detection` infrastructure hang, not a Squad defect. Rule D is now a **formal gate on this procedure** (see *Rule D — the gate and its escape hatch* below), and any re-run must score it explicitly rather than treating an unobserved run as green.

## Single Most Important Line of Evidence

The run *name* changed:

- **Pre-fix:** `Squad — run` — dispatched with an **empty command**. This is the defect that caused junk issues #12 and #14 to be minted.
- **Post-fix:** `Squad — implement` — dispatched with the **command carried**.

Same trigger. Same inputs. Different result. This is the fix in action.

---

## Autonomy Blockers

These are **not Squad defects** but they DO prevent the loop from closing unattended.

### 1. `GITHUB_TOKEN`-authored PRs do not trigger workflows at all

Worker-opened PRs are authored by `app/github-actions`. **GitHub suppresses workflow triggers entirely for events raised by the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`** — this exists to prevent recursive workflow loops.

> ⚠️ **Corrected 2026-08-24.** This section previously said such PRs are *parked* in `action_required` pending manual approval. **Measured false on fixture PR #4:** no `pull_request` run was created at all. The check rollup carried only `dynamic`-event checks (CodeQL, dependency submission) — there was nothing queued, nothing pending, and nothing to approve. The practical consequence is the same (the loop cannot close unattended), but the cause is different, and the distinction matters operationally: **you will search for a run ID that was never created.**

**The loop cannot close unattended until PR creation uses a PAT or GitHub App token instead of the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`.** That remains the correct fix — it changes the actor, so the trigger fires normally.

Manual override during testing — push an empty commit to the PR branch as a real user, which raises a `synchronize` event under your own identity:
```sh
git commit --allow-empty -m "trigger CI" && git push
```

> The `actions/runs/<RUN_ID>/approve` API this section used to recommend **cannot apply here**: approval acts on an existing queued run, and in this failure mode no run exists. Keep it in mind only for the genuinely distinct `action_required` case (first-time outside contributors), which is not what worker PRs hit.

### 2. Detection-Job Hang

gh-aw gates safe-output application behind a `detection` job. Tonight it hung **>35 minutes** on the `Install ripgrep` step. Every prior step had succeeded, and Squad's `agent` job had already completed successfully in 1m46s.

**Latency between "agent decided" and "effect visible" is unbounded.** This is an infrastructure issue with the gh-aw runner environment, not a Squad logic issue.

Diagnose which step is hung:
```sh
gh api "repos/<owner>/<repo>/actions/jobs/<JOB_ID>" --jq '.steps[] | select(.status != "completed")'
```

Operational guidance: if the `detection` job has not completed within ~10 minutes of the `agent` job finishing, cancel the run and re-trigger manually.

---

## Not Verified: Epic Closure (Rule D)

Epic closure was not re-tested after the fix. The session ended while the `detection` job hung. This is **not a Squad regression** — the infra hang prevented observation, not a logic failure.

Rule D is now a formal gate on E1 (see next section). It is **not** getting its own scenario number — an earlier draft of the E-series referred to a "future E2 experiment," but that scenario was never authored. Rule D shares E1's trigger (the merge-continuation relay closing the last leaf), so verifying it separately would either duplicate E1 or fabricate the state — neither is worth a distinct procedure. See `.squad/e2e/README.md` for the numbering history.

---

## Rule D — the gate and its escape hatch

**Added post-execution, 2026-08-21.** Any re-run of E1 MUST score Rule D explicitly rather than defaulting to green on absence of contrary evidence.

### The gate

**Trigger.** All leaf tasks under an epic have been merged (their child issues CLOSED) and the merge-continuation relay has been observed to dispatch (i.e. E1's other 7 gates have passed on the final leaf).

**Rule D verdict — three possible outcomes:**

- ✅ **PASS** — the epic issue is CLOSED within a stated observation window (default: 10 minutes after the last leaf's merge-continuation relay run reaches `success`). The closure is attributed to Squad (either commented by the coordinator or effected via a Squad-authored PR/dispatch), not a manual close.
- ❌ **FAIL** — the epic is OPEN at window expiry. Full stop. Whether a closure was never attempted, fired against the wrong target, or fired and errored is *evidence recorded on the FAIL*, not a precondition for reaching it. A **late closure** (epic transitions to CLOSED after window expiry) is also a FAIL: the verdict is fixed at expiry and does not retroactively flip to PASS. Record the late-closure fact, run URL, and delay in the finding — the score is still FAIL because E1's whole point is that closure was supposed to be autonomous *and* on-time.
- ⚠️ **NOT VERIFIED** — the observation was blocked by an infrastructure hang (`detection` on `Install ripgrep` is the known offender). Record the observation-blocking job's URL and step and the exact minute the run was cancelled. A NOT VERIFIED verdict is *not* a green: it is a documented absence of signal, and it does not close #1758.2 or any successor.

### The escape hatch (required text on any NOT VERIFIED result)

```yaml
rule_d:
  verdict: NOT VERIFIED
  reason: "detection job hung >N min on step '<step name>'; observation window expired before closure could be witnessed"
  blocked_by_job_url: "https://github.com/<owner>/<fixture>/actions/runs/<run_id>/job/<job_id>"
  blocked_by_step: "<step name>"
  cancelled_at_utc: "<yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ>"
  observation_window_min: 10
  window_started_utc: "<yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ>"      # when the relay run reached success
  window_ended_utc:   "<yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ>"      # cancelled_at_utc for hang; +window_min otherwise
```

**Do not omit any of these fields on a NOT VERIFIED.** An escape hatch that accepts blank fields becomes a way to score anything as NOT VERIFIED. If any of the required text is missing, treat the result as **FAIL** (blocked-observation is a claim; unsubstantiated blocked-observation is silence).

**Cross-checks (completeness is not veracity).** Each of these must hold; otherwise the NOT VERIFIED verdict itself is invalid and the run scores **FAIL**:

- `blocked_by_job_url` MUST target the fixture repo. Concretely: the URL path MUST contain `/<fixture-owner>/<fixture-repo>/actions/runs/`, where `<fixture-owner>/<fixture-repo>` is the `$FIXTURE` declared in *PASS observation* below (currently `octodemo/aspiregregator-squad-e2e`). A cancelled run from an unrelated repo satisfies the field type but does not support the claim. **Match on owner *and* name, not the bare name.** The repo name `aspiregregator-squad-e2e` was deliberately reused when the fixture moved orgs on 2026-08-24, so a name-only match cannot distinguish the current fixture from the retired one and would accept evidence from a repo that no longer exists.
- `cancelled_at_utc` MUST fall within `[window_started_utc, window_ended_utc]`. A cancellation *before* the window opened wasn't blocking Rule D observation; a cancellation *after* the window closed didn't cause the NOT VERIFIED — the window already ended.
- `blocked_by_step` MUST name a step visible on the linked run and MUST still be `in_progress` (not `completed`) at cancellation time. A step that had already returned before the run was cancelled didn't hang.

These cross-checks are the difference between "documented absence of signal" (this hatch's whole point) and "any convenient cancelled run around the same time will do."

### PASS observation (the mandatory extractions)

```powershell
$FIXTURE = "octodemo/aspiregregator-squad-e2e"   # re-run target (2026-08-24 onward). NOT the
                                                 # repo named in this record's header — that one
                                                 # was deleted. See the header note.
$EPIC = <epic issue number>

# The relay run's success timestamp — the start of the observation window.
# Rule D house rule: every `gh … 2>$null` in this document is followed by an
# `$LASTEXITCODE` assertion. The stderr suppression keeps the terminal clean;
# the exit-code check keeps a silent failure from being scored as "no matching
# run" (which for this cell would zero out `window_started_utc`).
gh run list --repo $FIXTURE --workflow "Squad" --limit 20 `
    --json databaseId,name,conclusion,updatedAt `
    --jq '.[] | select(.conclusion=="success" and (.name|test("implement|relay"; "i"))) |
         [(.databaseId|tostring),.name,.updatedAt] | join("  |  ")' 2>$null
if ($LASTEXITCODE -ne 0) {
    Write-Host "relay-timestamp extract: INCONCLUSIVE — gh run list exited $LASTEXITCODE. The line above is silence, not 'no matching run'. Do NOT set `window_started_utc` from this output; fix auth/network and re-run before scoring Rule D."
}

# Epic state at the end of the observation window.
gh issue view $EPIC --repo $FIXTURE --json state,closedAt,timelineItems `
    --jq '{state,closedAt,closer:(.timelineItems[]|select(.__typename=="ClosedEvent")|.actor.login)}' 2>$null
if ($LASTEXITCODE -ne 0) {
    Write-Host "epic-state extract: INCONCLUSIVE — gh issue view exited $LASTEXITCODE. This cell is DISPOSITIVE for Rule D: an empty response is not 'epic OPEN' and not 'epic CLOSED'. Do NOT score the verdict from silence; fix the fetch and re-run before assigning PASS / FAIL / NOT VERIFIED."
}
```

**PASS attribution rule.** `closer` must be a Squad-owned actor (`app/github-actions` posting a Squad workflow closure, or the coordinator's Squad-authored PR merging). A closure attributed to a human operator during the observation window is **not** a Rule D PASS — it is a Rule D FAIL that was manually papered over, and E1's whole point is that closure was supposed to be autonomous.

### FAIL observation

Record the full `gh run list --workflow "Squad"` output for the observation window along with the epic's `state` and `openIssues` count. A FAIL says the closure logic did not fire — that is the finding.
