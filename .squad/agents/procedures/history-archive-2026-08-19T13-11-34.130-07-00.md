### Issue Triage (2026-03-22T06:44:01Z)

**Flight triaged 6 unlabeled issues and filed 1 new issue.**

Procedures assigned:
- **#485 (Agent Specification PRD)** → squad:flight + squad:procedures (architecture decision + formal spec structure)

Pattern: Agent specification gap identified. Procedures owns formal spec structure and documentation; Flight owns architecture decisions.

📌 **Team update (2026-03-26T06:41:00Z — Crash Recovery Execution & Model Catalog Merge):** Procedures executed Round 2 PR merge action: rebased PR #619 (model catalog refresh, issue #588) onto dev branch from main, resolved 3 merge conflicts, and successfully merged. Model catalog now current: default model bumped to `claude-sonnet-4.6` (latest standard-tier Claude), specialist bumped to `gpt-5.3-codex` (latest code-writing specialist), fallback chains restructured to include new models (`gpt-5.4`, `gpt-5.4-mini`) and removed dead models (`claude-opus-4.6-fast`). All 6 original merge-plan PRs (#620, #627, #624, #611, #617, #619) now ✅ complete. Dev branch green (5,038 tests). Decision inbox merged to decisions.md and deleted. Next: Ready for follow-on feature PRs.

📌 **Team update (2026-03-22T06:44:01Z):** Flight issued comprehensive triage. Procedures owns Agent Specification PRD structure (#485). Architecture decisions from Flight. Coordinate on formal spec format and standard structure for future agent definitions.

## Historical Learnings Summary (condensed 2026-03-10 → 2026-04-17)

- **Deterministic skill pattern (2026-03-10):** Skills must have explicit SCOPE (what they produce/don't) and AGENT WORKFLOW (deterministic steps with STOP condition). Same input → same output, every time.
- **Self-contained skills (2026-03-15):** Resources (scripts, examples, configs) live WITH the skill directory, not in separate template dirs. Agents copy resources from the skill; no manual steps.
- **Three governance policies (2026-03-15):** Agent Error Lockout (2 errors → reassign), Product Isolation Rule (tests/CI/code never depend on squad names), Peer Quality Check (run tests before finishing). Applied to all 19 charters.
- **Team-wide reskill (2026-03-16):** 17.4% size reduction — NEVER/ALWAYS sections compress to single-paragraph summaries; essential workflow details stay verbose.
- **Economy mode skill (2026-03-22):** Layer 3 modifier only — never downgrades Layers 0-2 (user intent). `💰` indicator in spawn acknowledgments. Session phrase, persistent config, or CLI flag activation.
- **Personal squad governance (2026-03-22):** `CONSULT_MODE: true` as spawn signal. Governance changes go to `decisions/inbox/` for Flight review — don't edit squad.agent.md directly.
- **Spawn template `name` fix (2025-07):** Every `task` tool spawn MUST include `name` set to agent's lowercase cast name. Without it, platform defaults to generic slugs.
- **Model catalog refresh (2025-07 / 2026-03-25):** Model catalogs drift. Search ALL model name strings when refreshing — not just the catalog list. Sync via `sync-templates.mjs` to all 5 copies.
- **VS Code routing investigation (2026-03-25):** CLI-centric enforcement language causes coordinator to work inline in VS Code. Fix: platform-neutral dispatch language + reinforcement at prompt bottom.
- **VS Code routing fix (2026-07):** Fix 1 + Fix 2 shipped. CRITICAL RULE rewritten to dispatcher-identity framing ("DISPATCHER, not a DOER") with dispatch mechanism table. Routing Enforcement Reminder added as final section. Remaining P1 fixes (template renaming, prompt slimming) deferred.
- **PR #619 rebase (2026-07):** When a PR has accumulated dev merge commits, use `git rebase --onto dev <parent-of-first-PR-commit>` to cherry-pick only relevant commits.
- **Trim copilot-instructions.md (#999, 2026-04-17):** 1300w/9KB → 397w/3KB. Extracted Protected Files to skill, consolidated Git Safety, removed duplication. Pattern: main instructions = routing/workflow; skills = domain-specific reference (lazy-loaded on demand).

## Learnings

📌 **Team update (2026-03-22T09-35Z — Wave 1):** Economy mode governance proposal and personal squad consult-mode governance proposal authored for squad.agent.md — both DRAFT, awaiting Flight review before merging. Economy mode adds Layer 3 table + spawn convention (`💰 economy`) + model catalog audit. Personal squad adds consult mode detection, path reference table, spawn guidance. Persistent model preference (Layer 0) documented. Proposed new skill: `.squad/skills/consult-mode/SKILL.md` (post-approval). Deterministic skill pattern proven effective. PR #503 open with skills module. Next: Flight review → merge governance to squad.agent.md. No blocking issues.

### 2026-03-10: Deterministic skill pattern

**Problem:** Skills were too loose. The distributed-mesh skill was tested in a real project (mesh-demo), and agents generated 76 lines of validator code, 5 test files with 43 tests, regenerated sync scripts that should have been copied from templates, and left decision files empty. The skill document let agents interpret intent instead of following explicit steps.

**Solution:** Rewrite skills to be fully deterministic:

1. **SCOPE section** (right after frontmatter, before Context)
   - ✅ THIS SKILL PRODUCES — exact list of files/artifacts
   - ❌ THIS SKILL DOES NOT PRODUCE — explicit negative list to prevent scope creep

2. **AGENT WORKFLOW section** — Step-by-step deterministic instructions
   - ASK: exact questions to ask the user
   - GENERATE: exactly which files to create, with schemas
   - WRITE: exactly which decision entry to write, with template
   - TELL: exact message to output to user
   - STOP: explicit stopping condition, with negative list of what NOT to do

3. **Fix ambiguous language:**
   - "do the task" → clarify this means "the agent's normal work" not "build something for the skill"
   - "Agent adds the field" → clarify this describes what a consuming agent does with data it READ
   - Phase descriptions → note that phases are project-level decisions, not auto-advanced

4. **Decision template** — inline markdown showing exactly what to write

5. **Anti-patterns for code generation** — explicit list of things NOT to build

**Pattern for other skills:** All skills should have SCOPE (what it produces, what it doesn't) and AGENT WORKFLOW (deterministic steps with STOP condition). Same input → same output, every time. Zero ambiguity.

📌 Team update (2026-03-14T22-01-14Z): Distributed mesh integrated with deterministic skill pattern — decided by Procedures, PAO, Flight, Network

### 2026-03-15: Self-contained skills pattern (agent-skills spec)

**Problem:** The distributed-mesh skill had a manual gap — Step 4 told the user to copy sync scripts from templates/mesh/ manually. This violated the GitHub agent-skills spec, which says: "add scripts, examples or other resources to your skill's directory. The skill instructions should tell Copilot when, and how, to use these resources."

**Solution:** Skills are self-contained bundles. Resources live WITH the skill, not in separate template directories:

1. **Bundle resources IN the skill directory:** Copy `sync-mesh.sh`, `sync-mesh.ps1`, and `mesh.json.example` into `.squad/skills/distributed-mesh/`
2. **Update SKILL.md workflow:**
   - Step 2: Reference `mesh.json.example` from THIS skill's directory
   - Step 3: COPY sync scripts from THIS skill's directory to project root (agent does it, not user)
   - Step 4: RUN `--init` if Zone 2 state repo specified (agent does it, not user)
3. **Update SCOPE section:** Clarify the skill PRODUCES the copied scripts (bundled resources ≠ generated code)
4. **Replicate to templates:** Copy entire skill directory to `templates/skills/`, `packages/squad-cli/templates/skills/`, `packages/squad-sdk/templates/skills/`

**Pattern for all skills:** Skills are self-contained. Scripts, examples, configs, and resources travel WITH the skill. The agent reads SKILL.md, sees "copy X from this directory," and does it. Zero manual steps.

### 2026-03-15: Three new governance policies added to agent system

**Task:** Brady directive — implement three new policies across the agent system:

1. **Agent Error Lockout** — Added to squad.agent.md. After 2 cumulative errors (build/test failures or reviewer rejection) on the same task, agent is locked out for that task only. Different agent takes over. Coordinator tracks and enforces; Scribe logs lockout events.

2. **Product Isolation Rule** — Added to every charter and squad.agent.md Constraints. Tests, CI, and product code must NEVER depend on specific agent names from any squad. "Our squad" must not impact "the squad." Use generic/parameterized values (e.g., "test-agent-1") instead of real agent names (Flight, EECOM, FIDO).

3. **Peer Quality Check** — Added to every charter. Before finishing work, agents must verify their changes don't break existing tests. Run test suite for files touched. Update history.md when learning from mistakes.

**Implementation:** Updated `.github/agents/squad.agent.md` (new section + constraint) and all 19 active agent charters in `.squad/agents/*/charter.md`.

**Pattern:** Policies added as subsections under "How I Work" in charters to ensure they're loaded with agent context. Coordinator-level policies live in squad.agent.md with explicit enforcement instructions.

### 2026-03-16: Team-wide reskill — 17.4% reduction

**Context:** Routine maintenance reskill, one day after previous reskill (2026-03-15). Last reskill brought the system from 117.4KB to 51.7KB. This pass focused on remaining oversized charters.

**Work done:**
- **Scribe (2143→1557):** Compressed workflow steps, kept essential commit instructions
- **Handbook (1807→1529):** Removed repetitive LLM-FIRST DOCS emphasis
- **FIDO (1715→1370):** Consolidated verbose NEVER/ALWAYS sections
- **Booster (1583→1368):** Same NEVER/ALWAYS compression pattern

**Results:** 26,721→17,088 bytes (charters), 28,602→28,602 bytes (histories), total 55,323→45,690 bytes. 9,633 bytes saved (17.4% reduction). All charters now ≤1.5KB.

**Skill extraction:** No new patterns extracted. CastingEngine integration work (from EECOM March 15) is still evolving — not yet mature enough for skill template. Histories all <12KB, no compression needed.

**Pattern:** NEVER/ALWAYS sections in charters compress well — fold bullet lists into single-paragraph summaries. Essential workflow details (Scribe's commit steps) should stay verbose.

### 2026-03-22: Economy mode skill and personal squad governance (#500, #344)

**Task:** Two governance tasks — economy mode skill design and personal squad coordinator awareness.

**Economy mode (SKILL.md):**
- Created `.squad/skills/economy-mode/SKILL.md` as a Layer 3 modifier, not a new resolution layer
- Key design decision: economy mode ONLY affects Layer 3 auto-selection — Layer 0/1/2 (user intent) always wins
- `💰` indicator in spawn acknowledgments keeps it transparent
- Activation via session phrase, persistent config (`economyMode: true` in config.json), or CLI flag
- Architecture trips shift from opus → sonnet; code tasks shift from sonnet → gpt-4.1/gpt-5-mini
- Confidence: `low` — first implementation, not yet validated

**Personal squad governance (proposals):**
- Gap analysis: coordinator has no consult mode awareness despite full SDK implementation
- Five gaps identified: Init Mode missing personal squad resolution, no consult mode detection, TEAM_ROOT has no personal-squad semantics, charter templates lack consult-mode patterns, no consult-mode skill
- Proposed `CONSULT_MODE: true` as spawn prompt signal, `🧳 consult` in acknowledgments
- Proposed new consult-mode skill (after governance approval — skill after governance, not before)

**Governance workflow pattern:** When proposals touch squad.agent.md (governance territory), write to `decisions/inbox/` for Flight review. Don't directly edit squad.agent.md — Flight reviews governance changes.

**Catalog audit finding:** `claude-sonnet-4.6`, `gpt-5.4`, `gpt-5.3-codex` appear in model-selection SKILL.md fallback chains but are absent from squad.agent.md's "Valid models" catalog. Documented in economy-mode governance proposal for Flight to address.

### Session 2 Summary (2026-03-22)

Wave 1 governance work on #500 and #344: authored economy-mode skill (`SKILL.md`), economy-mode governance proposal, and personal-squad governance proposal. Caught `claude-sonnet-4.6` missing from valid models catalog. PR #503 (`squad/500-344-governance`) merged to dev.

### 2025-07: Spawn template `name` parameter fix (#577)

**Problem:** Agent cast names weren't displayed during work — the tasks panel showed generic slugs like "general-purpose-task" instead of the cast name. Root cause: spawn templates in `squad.agent.md` specified `description` but NOT the `name` parameter for the `task` tool. The `name` parameter generates the human-readable agent ID shown in the tasks panel.

**Fix:** Added `name: "{name}"` (lowercase cast name) to all spawn templates in `.squad-templates/squad.agent.md`:
- Lightweight Spawn Template
- Model-passing example
- Main full spawn template ("Template for any agent")
- Scribe spawn template (hardcoded `name: "scribe"`)

Also updated: examples section (showing `name` + `description` pairs), anti-pattern #4 (now covers both `name` and `description`), and Constraints section (requiring `name` on every spawn).

**Pattern:** Every `task` tool spawn MUST include `name` set to the agent's lowercase cast name. Without it, the platform defaults to generic slugs. The `description` parameter is for the human-readable summary; `name` is for the agent ID.

📌 **Team update (2026-03-23T23:15Z):** Orchestration complete. Agent name display refactor shipped: spawn templates updated with mandatory `name` parameter across all 4 template variants. VOX and FIDO coordinated on parser extraction and cascading pattern strategies. All decisions merged to decisions.md. Canonical source: `.squad-templates/squad.agent.md` (all derived copies secondary).

📌 **Team update (2026-03-25T18:11Z):** Model catalog updated to current platform offerings — removed 2 stale models (claude-opus-4.6-fast, gpt-5), added 5 new models (claude-sonnet-4.6, claude-opus-4.6-1m, gpt-5.4, gpt-5.3-codex, gpt-5.4-mini), bumped defaults (code: claude-sonnet-4.6, specialist: gpt-5.3-codex), restructured fallbacks. All 5 squad.agent.md template copies synchronized. Merged in #588.

### 2025-07: Model catalog refresh (#588)

**Problem:** The valid models catalog, fallback chains, role-to-model mappings, and default model references in `squad.agent.md` were stale — missing `claude-sonnet-4.6`, `gpt-5.4`, `gpt-5.3-codex`, `gpt-5.4-mini`, `claude-opus-4.6-1m` and still referencing removed models `claude-opus-4.6-fast` and standalone `gpt-5`.

**Fix:** Full catalog refresh across all model-referencing sections:
- Catalog: added 5 new models, removed 2 stale ones
- Defaults: code-writing tasks bumped to `claude-sonnet-4.6` (newest standard); code specialist bumped to `gpt-5.3-codex`
- Fallback chains: restructured with new models in sensible positions (e.g., `gpt-5.4-mini` in fast tier, `gpt-5.4` in standard)
- All 5 copies synced via `sync-templates.mjs`

**Pattern:** Model catalogs drift. When the platform adds/removes models, every section referencing models needs updating — not just the catalog list. Search for all model name strings before considering the refresh complete.
### 2026-03-25: VS Code routing enforcement investigation (#613)

**Problem:** In VS Code, the coordinator reads routing rules but doesn't enforce them — continues working inline instead of dispatching via `runSubagent`. Andreas (andikrueger) reproduced and the agent itself admitted it violated the rules.

**Root cause (dominant):** CLI-centric enforcement language. The CRITICAL RULE says "MUST use the `task` tool" — but in VS Code the dispatch tool is `runSubagent`. When `task` isn't available, the coordinator falls through Platform Detection's "Fallback mode" (work inline) instead of using `runSubagent`. The VS Code adaptations section is buried 360 lines below the CRITICAL RULE and reads as optional, not mandatory.

**Amplifying factors:**
1. Prompt saturation: 950 lines / 80KB. Routing constraint competes with 900+ lines of governance, lifecycle, and reference material. Core dispatch loop is ~200 lines; rest is noise.
2. Template duplication: CLI 1.0.11 discovers all `*.agent.md` from cwd to git root. Squad has 5 copies — only `.github/agents/squad.agent.md` should be discoverable.

**Proposed fixes (5 total, prioritized):**
- P0: Rewrite enforcement language to be platform-neutral ("dispatch tool" not "`task` tool")
- P0: Add routing reinforcement at bottom of prompt (LLMs weight start/end more than middle)
- P1: Rename template copies to `.agent.md.template` to prevent CLI discovery
- P1: Extract ~350 lines to lazy-loaded reference files (worktree, Ralph, casting, MCP)
- P1: Move VS Code dispatch block immediately after CRITICAL RULE

**Key pattern learned:** Enforcement language must name ALL dispatch mechanisms, not just the CLI one. Platform-specific instructions buried deep in a long prompt get lost — they need to be co-located with the constraint they modify. LLM attention patterns favor prompt boundaries (top/bottom) over the middle.

**Proposal filed:** `.squad/decisions/inbox/procedures-vscode-routing-fix.md`

### 2026-07: VS Code routing enforcement — Fix 1 + Fix 2 shipped (#613)

**Implemented** P0 fixes from the VS Code routing proposal:

- **Fix 1 (Platform-Neutral Enforcement):** Rewrote CRITICAL RULE from CLI-specific "`task` tool" language to dispatcher-identity framing ("You are a DISPATCHER, not a DOER") with explicit dispatch mechanism table (CLI → `task`, VS Code → `runSubagent`, fallback → inline as last resort). Updated all 7 enforcement-context references throughout squad.agent.md: anti-patterns #1/#2/#3, constraints block, and spawn template header.

- **Fix 2 (Top-and-Bottom Reinforcement):** Added `## ⚠️ Routing Enforcement Reminder` as final section, exploiting LLM prompt-boundary attention bias. Reinforces dispatcher identity at both top and bottom of the prompt.

**Branch:** `squad/613-vscode-routing-enforcement` — canonical source edited, synced to all 5 copies via `scripts/sync-templates.mjs`, build verified clean.

**Remaining P1 fixes** (template renaming, prompt slimming, VS Code block relocation) deferred to separate PRs per the proposal's ship order.

### 2026-07: PR #619 rebase and merge — model catalog final sync

**Problem:** PR #619 (model catalog update, #588) was the last of 6 PRs in the pre-crash triage merge plan. It had accumulated old dev merge commits and was behind after PRs #620, #627, #624, #611, and #617 merged first. Template renames from #624 (`.agent.md` → `.agent.md.template`) changed which files needed updating.

**Fix:** Used targeted `git rebase --onto dev <base>` to replay only the 2 actual PR commits (skipping accumulated dev merge noise). Rebase applied cleanly — one commit landed, one was auto-dropped as already upstream. After rebase, only `packages/squad-sdk/templates/squad.agent.md.template` and `templates/squad.agent.md.template` needed changes since the canonical and other copies already had the model updates from earlier merges.

**Pattern:** When a PR branch has accumulated merge commits from dev, use `git rebase --onto dev <parent-of-first-PR-commit>` to cherry-pick only the relevant commits. This avoids conflict noise from old merge commits that are already in dev. Also: after template renames, the sync script may overwrite version stamps in the canonical file — revert those before pushing.

### 2026-04-17: Trim copilot-instructions.md (#999)

**Task:** Reduce `.github/copilot-instructions.md` from ~1,300 words / 9KB to ≤750 words / ≤4KB to reduce attention dilution for the Copilot coding agent.

**Key decisions:**
- Extracted Protected Files (file list, rules, SDK/CLI boundary, anti-patterns) to `.copilot/skills/protected-files/SKILL.md` — replaced with 2-sentence pointer
- Consolidated Git Safety from 4 sub-sections (Staging, Pushing, Pre-Push Checklist, Branch Contamination Prevention) into a single 7-item flat list; resolved contradictory `git fetch upstream` vs `git fetch origin` (kept `origin`)
- Compacted Changeset Requirement from 7 lines + code block to 2 sentences
- Reordered: Team Context, Capability Self-Check, Branch Naming now appear before Git Safety (essential workflow first, safety rules second)
- Removed duplication with `.squad/copilot-instructions.md` (5 sections were verbatim copies; kept compact versions since both files load)
- Sweeping Refactor Rules condensed from 5-step list to 2-sentence pointer

**Result:** 397 words / 3KB — well within target. PR #1002.

**Files modified:** `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.copilot/skills/protected-files/SKILL.md` (new).

**Pattern:** When trimming agent instructions, extract domain-specific reference content to skills (lazy-loaded on demand) and keep the main instructions file as a routing/workflow document. Skills are the right abstraction for "read this when you touch X" — they don't consume tokens until needed.

### 2025-07: Model catalog refresh (#588)

**Pattern:** Model catalogs drift. When the platform adds/removes models, every section referencing models needs updating — not just the catalog list. Search for all model name strings before considering the refresh complete.
### 2026-03-25: VS Code routing enforcement investigation (#613)

**Problem:** In VS Code, the coordinator reads routing rules but doesn't enforce them — continues working inline instead of dispatching via `runSubagent`. Andreas (andikrueger) reproduced and the agent itself admitted it violated the rules.

**Root cause (dominant):** CLI-centric enforcement language. The CRITICAL RULE says "MUST use the `task` tool" — but in VS Code the dispatch tool is `runSubagent`. When `task` isn't available, the coordinator falls through Platform Detection's "Fallback mode" (work inline) instead of using `runSubagent`. The VS Code adaptations section is buried 360 lines below the CRITICAL RULE and reads as optional, not mandatory.

**Amplifying factors:**
1. Prompt saturation: 950 lines / 80KB. Routing constraint competes with 900+ lines of governance, lifecycle, and reference material. Core dispatch loop is ~200 lines; rest is noise.
2. Template duplication: CLI 1.0.11 discovers all `*.agent.md` from cwd to git root. Squad has 5 copies — only `.github/agents/squad.agent.md` should be discoverable.

**Proposed fixes (5 total, prioritized):**
- P0: Rewrite enforcement language to be platform-neutral ("dispatch tool" not "`task` tool")
- P0: Add routing reinforcement at bottom of prompt (LLMs weight start/end more than middle)
- P1: Rename template copies to `.agent.md.template` to prevent CLI discovery
- P1: Extract ~350 lines to lazy-loaded reference files (worktree, Ralph, casting, MCP)
- P1: Move VS Code dispatch block immediately after CRITICAL RULE

**Key pattern learned:** Enforcement language must name ALL dispatch mechanisms, not just the CLI one. Platform-specific instructions buried deep in a long prompt get lost — they need to be co-located with the constraint they modify. LLM attention patterns favor prompt boundaries (top/bottom) over the middle.

**Proposal filed:** `.squad/decisions/inbox/procedures-vscode-routing-fix.md`

### 2026-07: VS Code routing enforcement — Fix 1 + Fix 2 shipped (#613)

**Implemented** P0 fixes from the VS Code routing proposal:

- **Fix 1 (Platform-Neutral Enforcement):** Rewrote CRITICAL RULE from CLI-specific "`task` tool" language to dispatcher-identity framing ("You are a DISPATCHER, not a DOER") with explicit dispatch mechanism table (CLI → `task`, VS Code → `runSubagent`, fallback → inline as last resort). Updated all 7 enforcement-context references throughout squad.agent.md: anti-patterns #1/#2/#3, constraints block, and spawn template header.

- **Fix 2 (Top-and-Bottom Reinforcement):** Added `## ⚠️ Routing Enforcement Reminder` as final section, exploiting LLM prompt-boundary attention bias. Reinforces dispatcher identity at both top and bottom of the prompt.

**Branch:** `squad/613-vscode-routing-enforcement` — canonical source edited, synced to all 5 copies via `scripts/sync-templates.mjs`, build verified clean.

**Remaining P1 fixes** (template renaming, prompt slimming, VS Code block relocation) deferred to separate PRs per the proposal's ship order.

### 2026-07: PR #619 rebase and merge — model catalog final sync

**Problem:** PR #619 (model catalog update, #588) was the last of 6 PRs in the pre-crash triage merge plan. It had accumulated old dev merge commits and was behind after PRs #620, #627, #624, #611, and #617 merged first. Template renames from #624 (`.agent.md` → `.agent.md.template`) changed which files needed updating.

**Fix:** Used targeted `git rebase --onto dev <base>` to replay only the 2 actual PR commits (skipping accumulated dev merge noise). Rebase applied cleanly — one commit landed, one was auto-dropped as already upstream. After rebase, only `packages/squad-sdk/templates/squad.agent.md.template` and `templates/squad.agent.md.template` needed changes since the canonical and other copies already had the model updates from earlier merges.

**Pattern:** When a PR branch has accumulated merge commits from dev, use `git rebase --onto dev <parent-of-first-PR-commit>` to cherry-pick only the relevant commits. This avoids conflict noise from old merge commits that are already in dev. Also: after template renames, the sync script may overwrite version stamps in the canonical file — revert those before pushing.

### 2026-04-17: Trim copilot-instructions.md (#999)

**Task:** Reduce `.github/copilot-instructions.md` from ~1,300 words / 9KB to ≤750 words / ≤4KB to reduce attention dilution for the Copilot coding agent.

**Key decisions:**
- Extracted Protected Files (file list, rules, SDK/CLI boundary, anti-patterns) to `.copilot/skills/protected-files/SKILL.md` — replaced with 2-sentence pointer
- Consolidated Git Safety from 4 sub-sections (Staging, Pushing, Pre-Push Checklist, Branch Contamination Prevention) into a single 7-item flat list; resolved contradictory `git fetch upstream` vs `git fetch origin` (kept `origin`)
- Compacted Changeset Requirement from 7 lines + code block to 2 sentences
- Reordered: Team Context, Capability Self-Check, Branch Naming now appear before Git Safety (essential workflow first, safety rules second)
- Removed duplication with `.squad/copilot-instructions.md` (5 sections were verbatim copies; kept compact versions since both files load)
- Sweeping Refactor Rules condensed from 5-step list to 2-sentence pointer

**Result:** 397 words / 3KB — well within target. PR #1002.

**Files modified:** `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.copilot/skills/protected-files/SKILL.md` (new).

**Pattern:** When trimming agent instructions, extract domain-specific reference content to skills (lazy-loaded on demand) and keep the main instructions file as a routing/workflow document. Skills are the right abstraction for "read this when you touch X" — they don't consume tokens until needed.

## 2026-08-20 — gh-aw pre-E2E triage (read-only)

Audited my 4 gh-aw issues (#1759, #1756, #1757, #1608) against `workflows/squad.md`.

- **#1759 confirmed LIVE.** `squad-plan` Step 3 (L637) and `squad-plan-implementation` (L851/L863) emit Owner/Agent columns with no rule binding them to cast names in `.squad/team.md`. Step 1 (L626) reads team.md but gives no mapping. Generic role strings leak → `squad:{owner}` label (L670) misroutes. Fix = explicit "Owner/Agent MUST be a cast name from team.md, formatted `Name (Role)`; fall back to role only if no team.md" in both skills. SHIP-NOW.
- **#1756**: `squad-research` Step 3 (L603) only enforces a ≥200-char floor (L605) — no evidence table, goals/non-goals, assumptions, open decisions, acceptance framing, or traceability IDs. The insight quality is subjective, but a required-sections structural contract is binary and observable. SHARPEN → ship the contract; let E2E inform insight tuning.
- **#1757**: DA-sections + own verdict is checkable, but "catches a bad plan" needs a golden corpus / is taste-based. Depends on #1756 + #1758 (wave 4). DEFER — let E2E inform it.
- **#1608**: p2, outer-coordinator integration, off critical path. DEFER wave 3.

Lesson: for quality-of-output issues, split the verifiable structural contract (ship) from the subjective judgment (E2E-informed). Never write success criteria as "works correctly."

## 📌 Team update — 2026-08-20T11:59:44-07:00

gh-aw workstream triage complete (7-agent read-only pass). Reconciled outcome: CLOSE 7 issues (#1738,#1762,#1764,#1768,#1763,#1604,#1609); SHIP-NOW 5 (#1772,#1758,#1759,#1732-compile,#1761); 2 contested (#1730,#1756); 12 deferred. Both P0s (#1772,#1758) still real — structural defects unresolved. Wave:1 cap=6. Tomorrow is a full-day E2E series against aspiregregator-squad-e2e. E2E will break at S3 if #1772 is not fixed first.
